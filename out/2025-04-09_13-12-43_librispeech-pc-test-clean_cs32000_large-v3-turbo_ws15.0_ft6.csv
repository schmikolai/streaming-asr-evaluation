The utility of consumption, as an evidence of wealth, is to be classed as a derivative growth. such consumption as falls through the women is merely incidental to their work. It is a means to their continued labor, and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life. With a further advance in culture, this taboo may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character, but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained, whether it be a taboo or a larger conventionality, the features of the conventional scheme of consumption consumption do not change easily. In the nature of things, luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class. class. Under the taboo, certain victuals, reserved for the use of the superior class. Drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific honorific as being a mark at the secondary move of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence. it has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle. The consumption of luxuries, in the true sense, is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer consumer himself, and is, therefore, a mark of the master master.

Consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country.

If the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his memory, when it assures him that there have been other times. But I do not think such an inference is warranted. Our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must, in fundamental cases, be based upon a characteristic characteristic of the image itself since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image. image. We sometimes have images that are which yet we do not trust. For example, we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted. Some images, feel very familiar, while others feel strange. Familiarity In an image of a a well -known face, for example, some parts may feel more familiar than others. When this happens, we have more belief belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts. I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past. They must have some characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past. In actual fact, there are doubtless various factors that concur greater or less remoteness in some remembered event. There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of pastness, especially where immediate memory is concerned. There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present, and knowing the time order of two remembered events. It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present. But it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of of dating remembered events. events.

We might correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analog in our knowledge of the future.

This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory, but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory.

Its origin was small, a germ, an insignificant seed hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition. Instead of but six regularly affiliated members, and at most two score of adherents, the organization numbers today many hundred thousand souls. In place of a single hamlet, in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated, there now are about 70 stakes of Zion and about 700 organized wards, each ward and stake with its full complement of officers and priesthood organizations. organizations. The practice of gathering its proselytes into one place strengthening of foreign branches, and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are seldom met with abroad, very erroneous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church. Nevertheless, the mustard seed, among the smallest of all seeds, has attained the proportions of a tree, and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now in oak, offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun not merely that the work of proselyting should be carried on in the west, but that the headquarters of the church should be there established. The Book of Mormon had taught the people the true and toward this dark -skinned remnant of a once mighty people, the missionaries of Mormonism early turned their eyes, and with their eyes went their hearts and their hopes. It is notable that the Indian tribes have generally regarded the religion of the Latter -day Saints with favor. seeing in the Book of Mormon striking agreement with their own traditions. The first well -established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of Kirtland, Ohio, almost within sight of Lake Erie. And here soon rose the first temple of modern times.

But from the first, they were unpopular among the the Missourians. The Lieutenant Governor pronounced Mormon hater, and throughout the period of the Troubles, he manifested sympathy with the persecutors. Their sufferings have never yet been fitly chronicled by human scribe, making their way across the river, most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of Clay County, and afterward established themselves in Caldwell County. therein founding the city of Far West. A small settlement had been founded by Mormon families on Shoal Creek, and here on the 30th of October, 1838, a company of 240 fell fell upon the hapless settlers and butchered a score. score be it said to the honor of some of the officers entrusted with a terrible commission, that when they learned its true significance, they resigned their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold -blooded butchery oh what a record to read! What a picture to gaze upon! How awful the fact! American schoolboys read with emotions of horror of the Albigenses driven, beaten, and killed, with a papal legate directing the butchery, and of the Faudois, vaudois, hunted and hounded like beasts, as the effect of a royal decree.

He was the last to turn to Christ. Paul came later and is beneath us. Indeed, he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time. Do you suppose that God, for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics, would disown his entire church? Against these boasting false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority in ministry. As the ambassador of a government is honored for his office, and not for his private person, so the minister of Christ should exalt his office, in order to gain authority among men. Paul takes pride in his ministry, not to his own praise, but to the praise of God. Either he calls ministers through the agency of men, or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles. Paul declares that the false apostles were called called or sent neither by men nor by man. The most they could claim is that they were sent by others. He mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by God. The call is not to be taken lightly. For a person to possess knowledge is not enough. It spoils one's best work. When I was a young man, I thought Paul of the ministry. i knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty and nobody understood spiritual boasting.

We are to hear Christ who has been teacher. At the same time, Paul confirms our creed that Christ is very God. that Christ is very God God is apparent in that Paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the Father, as, for instance, the power to dispense grace and peace to bestow peace and grace grace lies in the province of God, who alone can create these blessings.

The influence which the Timaeus has exercised upon posterity is due partly to a misunderstanding. In the supposed depths of this dialogue, the Neoplatonists found hidden meanings in in connections with the jewish and christian scriptures, and out of them, they elicited doctrines quite at variance with the spirit of Plato. Plato. plato they were absorbed in his theology and were under the dominion of his name while that which was truly great and truly characteristic in him, his effort to realize and connect abstractions, was not understood by them at all. there is no danger of the modern commentators on the Timaeus falling into the absurdities of the neoplatonists In the present day, we are well aware that an ancient philosopher is to be interpreted from himself and by the contemporary history of thought thought. The fancies of the because they exhibit a phase of the human mind which prevailed widely in the first centuries of the Christian era and is not wholly extinct in our own day. But they have nothing to do with the interpretation of Plato and in spirit they are opposed to him. We do not his own dialogues, or whether the thought of arranging any of them, besides the two trilogies which he has expressly connected was ever present to his mind mind. The dialogue is creation, including under this term, the heavenly bodies and with man only as one among among the animals. But he has not as yet defined this intermediate territory which lies somewhere between medicine and mathematics and he would have felt that there was as great an impiety in ranking theories of physics first in the order of knowledge as in placing the body before the soul. soul. With Heraclitus, he like Anaxagoras, he asserts the predominance of mind, although admitting an element of necessity which which reason is incapable of subduing. like the pythagoreans he supposes the mystery of the world to be contained in in number. Many, pre -Socratic philosophy are included in the Timaeus. it is probable that the relation of the ideas to god or of god to the world was differently conceived by him at different times of his life the ideas also remain but they have become types in nature Forms of men, animals, birds, fishes. The style and plan of the Tineas differ greatly from that of any other of the Platonic Platonic dialogues. But Plato has not the same mastery over Nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner but in the rest of the work, the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given given up. He could write in another. and the Greek language has not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena. And hence, we find the same sort of clumsiness in the Timaeus of Plato, which characterizes the philosophical poem of Lucretius. There is a want of flow, and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more more of repetition than occurs in Plato's earlier writings. writings.

This truth, is confirmed by his face, in which we have both beheld that of our son. Just then Leocadia came to herself, and embracing the cross seemed from beginning to end, Leocadia's whole story, and he believed it, through the blessed dispensation of heaven, which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies. so persuasive were her entreaties and so strong her assurances that no harm whatever could result to them from the information she sought. sought, they were induced to confess that one summer's summer's night, the same she had mentioned, themselves and another friend being out on a stroll with Rodolfo, they had been concerned in the abduction of a girl, whom Rodolfo carried off, whilst the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry, and would have defended her if they could.

But a word further concerning the expedition in general. it was through floyd's advice that Buchanan ordered the military expedition to Utah. ostensibly, to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion, which in fact had never come into existence, but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists. Moreover, had the people been inclined to rebellion, what greater opportunity could they have wished? already a north and a south were talked of why not set up also a west they knew no north no south no east no West. They stood positively by the Constitution, and would have nothing to do unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once loyally responded to furnish men in arms for the country's need.

Federal judges and United States attorneys in Utah, who were not Mormons nor lovers of Mormonism, refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest manifest injustice and inadequacy. This meant that for an alleged misdemeanor, for which Congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment and a fine of $300, a man might be imprisoned for life, I, for many terms of a man's natural life, did the court's power to enforce its sentences extend so far, and might be fined millions of dollars. dollars before this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and there met with the reversal and rebuke it deserved, men were imprisoned under sentence of many years' duration. the people contested these measures measures one by one in the courts, presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject, and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure. Then the church was disincorporated, and its property both real and personal, confiscated and etiated to the government of the United States. States. And although the real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the court's receiver, and the Mormon church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property. and so the story of mormonism runs on Its finale has not yet been written. the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress, new developments of its plan.",the army found the people in poverty and left them in comparative wealth but a word further concerning the expedition in general it was through floyds advice that buchanan ordered the military expedition to utah ostensibly to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion which in fact had never come into existence but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists moreover had the people been inclined to rebellion what greater opportunity could they have wished already a north and a south were talked of why not set up also a west they knew no north no south no east no west they stood positively by the constitution and would have nothing to do unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once loyally responded to furnish men in arms for the countrys need what the latter -day saints call celestial marriage is characteristic of the church and is in very general practice but of celestial marriage plurality of wives resurrection and an actual hereafter in which future states shall be recognized every sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earth of parent and child brother and sister husband and wife it has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one and i have yet to find the place place and meet the people where and with whom the purity of man and woman is held more more precious than among the maligned mormons in the mountain valleys of the west at the inception of plural marriage among the latter -day saints there was no law law national or state against against its practice in 1862 a law was enacted with the purpose of as had been predicted in the national senate prior to its passage it lay for many years a dead letter federal judges and united states attorneys in utah who were not mormons nor lovers of mormonism refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest manifest injustice and inadequacy this meant that for an alleged misdemeanor for which congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months imprisonment and a fine of $300 a man might be imprisoned for life i for many terms of a mans natural life did the courts power to enforce its sentences extend so far and might be fined millions of dollars dollars before this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort and there met with the reversal and rebuke it deserved men were imprisoned under sentence of many years duration the people contested these measures measures one by one in the courts presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure then the church was disincorporated and its property both real and personal confiscated and etiated to the government of the united states states and although the real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the courts receiver and the mormon church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property and so the story of mormonism runs on its finale has not yet been written the current press presents continuously new stages of its progress new developments of its plan

I can't see it in that light, said the old lawyer it was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved, but they could not have proven a case against Lucy if she was innocent and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere bluff. he was soft -hearted and impetuous impetuous said beth and being in love he didn't stop to count the cost. if the prosecution were were withdrawn and the case settled with the victim of the forged check then the young man would be allowed his freedom but under the circumstances i doubt if such an arrangement could be made fairview is twelve miles away but by ten o 'clock they drew up at the county jail they were received in the little office by a man named Markham, who was the jailer. jailer we wish to talk with him answered Kenneth.

Then, heaving a heavy sigh, probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned, he added, It is what I would wish to practice myself, as one without a cross of blood, though it is not always easy to deal with an Indian as you would with a fellow Christian.

he was somewhat skeptical on the subject of a bears singing and yet yet he had been assured of the latter on the testimony of his own exquisite organs there was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind mind the ingenious in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation the bear shook his shaggy sides and then a well -known voice replied can these things be returned david breathing more freely as the truth began

growled the cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too continued david improving the hint he received they must stand further off then as if

But when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb, a group of dwellings on the outskirts, a remote country residence, or a farmhouse, the alternating current in all elements, save its danger, was and is ideal. Edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy, and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross -examination by microscope, test tube, and galvanometer. unless he could secure an engine of smoother running and more exactly govern and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp, Edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light.

And Mr. Edison marine engine started before the ship left New York and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine engine for his purposes must produce light at all times.

Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water, and he proceeded to to develop a meter. There was infinite skepticism around him on the subject, and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought, the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed, and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use, could not be brought to accurate registration.

One of Mr. Hopkins' first tasks, after calling his faithful henchmen around him, was to make a careful canvas of the voters of his district to see what was still to be accomplished. the weak -kneed contingency must be strengthened and fortified and a couple of hundred votes in one way or the other other secured from the opposition. the democratic committee figured out a way to do this. Under ordinary conditions, him in order to elect hopkins the only thing necessary was to fix Seth Reynolds, and this hopkins arranged personally and this was why kenneth and Beth discovered him conversing with the young woman in the buggy. The description to the women's political league was so humorous and diverting that they were both laughing heartily over the thing when the young people passed them and thus mr hopkins failed to notice who the occupants of the other vehicle were. these women were flattered by the attention of the young lady and had promised to assist in electing Mr. Forbes.
