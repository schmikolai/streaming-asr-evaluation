My first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side. side. some of the touches indeed indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge. edge edge it is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of of Carpaccio's.

Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues, it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper. and that I am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all around it, being sure that... even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels. if they are gradated. gradated justly. justly but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly.

What is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates, images and expectations of their usual correlates, all of which are subjectively indistinguishable. indistinguishable from the sensation. sensation. Whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions, everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth truth though the word exactly might seem an overstatement, and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions. And what sort of evidence is logically possible There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago exactly as it then was with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past. All that I am doing is to use its logical tunability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember. The behaviorist who attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making making the record. record. Habit is a concept involving the occurrence the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit, that can only be because he trusts his memory. when it assures him that there have been other times. times. But I do not think such an inference is warranted. warranted. warranted our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must, in fundamental cases be be based upon a characteristic of the image itself. itself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image. We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague, which yet we do not not trust. For example, under the influence of fatigue, fatigue, we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted. distorted. Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar, while others feel strange. Familiarity is a feeling capable of... degrees. degrees.

I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have. have in order to account for our knowledge of the past. past. They must have some characteristics. characteristic which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past. past. In actual fact, there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of of greater or less remoteness. in some remembered event. There may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of of pastness, especially where immediate memory is concerned. concerned. There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event. event to the present and knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present, the time order of two remembered events. events. It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately. accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present. to the present. present. But it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of the present. of dating dating remembered events. events. If we had retained the subject or act in knowledge, the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple. remembering Remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered. remembered. Some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory, must arrive at. In this case, may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague vague. The first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past. past. We might provisionally, though perhaps not quite correctly, define memory as that way of knowing about the past. past which has no analog in our knowledge of the future. Such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy. This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory, but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory. theory. A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidence of its past, and people are not so different from gramophones. gramophones as they like to believe. I can set to work now to remember remember things I never remembered remembered before such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning. morning, and it can hardly be holy habit that enables me to do this. this. The fact that a man can recite any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it. Simmons' two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do not touch knowledge memory at all closely closely. They give which images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences. occurrences, which is what constitutes constitutes knowledge memory. It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge. knowledge. it is by no means always reliable. reliable. Almost everybody at some time experienced the well -known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time. time. Whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object. object, which leads us to the judgment. judgment. This Thus, no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity. familiarity alone. alone. A further stage is recognition. recognition.

We are, of course, in fact, able to to judge when we recognize. recognize an object that we have seen it before. before, but this judgment is something over and and above recognition. recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense. sense of the word. word.

There are, however, several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate. inadequate. to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as I have seen this before, than as, this has existed before. before The definition of my experience is difficult. difficult. Broadly speaking, what I am experiencing now by certain lengths of which the various forms of memory are among the most important. important thus if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which I recognize it, forms part of my experience, by definition. definition.
