studious of division and while the chiaroscurists devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing thing unseparated light the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light light my first and principal reason was that they enforced beyond all resistance resistance on any student who might attempt to copy them this method of laying portions of distinct hue side by side side some of the touches indeed indeed when the tint has been mixed with much water have been laid in little drops or ponds so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge edge edge it is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of of carpaccios one of his series of the life of st george then he comes to the beak of it it the brown ground beneath is left for the most part one touch of black is put for the hollow two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible for believe me the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a a cock robin is to be read and of a grass plot to be green green and the best skill of art is an instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light which you can only seize by precision precision of instantaneous touch now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues it becomes somehow more precious and pearly than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all around it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated gradated justly justly but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly they are beyond all other works that i know existing existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones tones their favorite choice in time of day day being either dawn or twilight twilight and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper paper it may be that a great colorless will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice but but loud or low the virtue is in both cases always in refinement never in loudness it must remember be one or the other other do not therefore therefore think that the gothic school is an easy one the law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly clearly or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful delightful and i have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground this at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative decorative that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way but not under existing conditions conditions and that in fact you are producing jewelers work rather than pictures pictures that a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous in all all early gothic art indeed you will find find failure of this kind especially distortion and rigidity which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art art the large letter feeble and ill -drawn figures figures that is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand hand it is not characteristic of gothic or any other school school but observe you can only do this on one condition that of striving also to create in reality the beauty which you seek in imagination imagination it will be wholly impossible for you you to retain the tranquility of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble purest purest painting unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life you must look at him in the face fight him conquer him with what scathe you may you need not says first of all as my delicious parquet was ruby so this nasty viper shall be black black black and then can i round him off even though he is black black and make him slimy slimy and yet springy and close down down clotted clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth all the same same nothing will be more precious to you i think in the practical study of art than the conviction which will force itself on you more and more every hour hour of the way all things are bound together little and great in spirit and in matter matter you know i have just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved involved itself at last in cloud and fire fire here is an equally typical greek school landscape by wilson wilson lost wholly in golden mist the trees so slightly drawn that you dont know if they are trees or towers towers and no care for color whatsoever whatsoever whatsoever perfectly deceptive and sunshine through the mist mist apollo and the python python python now here is raphael exactly between the two trees still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance distance well then last here is turners turners greek school of the highest class class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire fire only there are two sorts of cloud and fire fire fire he knows them one and theres another another the dudley and the flint it is only a pencil outlined by edward byrne jones in illustration of the story of psyche it is the introduction of psyche after all her troubles into heaven heaven every plant in the grass is set formally grows perfectly and may be realized completely completely exquisite order and universal with eternal life and light this is the faith and effort of the schools of crystal and you may describe and complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of chaucer in his tender mood and observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness first and then on the order order thus in chaucers dream dream in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature though suffering is still dignified and beautiful beautiful but now here is the subject of which you will wonder at first why turner drew it at all it has no beauty whatsoever no specialty of of picturesqueness and all all its lines are cramped and poor the crampedness and the poverty are all intended it is a gleaner bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old watermill itself mossy and rent scarcely able to get its stones to turn the scene is

some remembered event there may be a specific feeling which could be called the feeling of of pastness especially where immediate memory is concerned concerned there is of course a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event event to the present and knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present the time order of two remembered events events it would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present to the present present but it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of the present of dating dating remembered events events if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple remembering remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered remembered some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at in this case may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague vague the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past past we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past past which has no analog in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy this distinction is vital to the understanding of memory but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory theory a gramophone by the help of suitable records might relate to us the incidence of its past and people are not so different from gramophones gramophones as they like to believe i can set to work now to remember remember things i never remembered remembered before such as what i had to eat for breakfast this morning morning and it can hardly be holy habit that enables me to do this this the fact that a man can recite any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it simmons two books mentioned in an earlier lecture do not touch knowledge memory at all closely closely they give which images of past occurrences come into our minds but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences occurrences which is what constitutes constitutes knowledge memory it is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge knowledge it is by no means always reliable reliable almost everybody at some time experienced the well -known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time time whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object object which leads us to the judgment judgment this thus no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity familiarity alone alone a further stage is recognition recognition recognition in this sense does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association association the kind of object we are seeing at the moment moment is associated with the word cat or with an auditory image of of purring or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize recognize in the cat of the moment we are of course in fact able to to judge when we recognize recognize an object that we have seen it before before but this judgment is something over and and above recognition recognition in this first sense and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense sense of the word word this knowledge is sense though in another it is not not there are however several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate inadequate to begin with it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as i have seen this before than as this has existed before before the definition of my experience is difficult difficult broadly speaking what i am experiencing now by certain lengths of which the various forms of memory are among the most important important thus if i recognize a thing the occasion of its previous existence in virtue of which i recognize it forms part of my experience by definition definition recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world of course the words this has existed before are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition recognition but that is unavoidable unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought thought which is by no means means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition,0.11883589329021826

regulator of speed but waited for an indicator to verify it then again there there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running running and mr edison informed a marine engine started before the ship left new york and continued running until it reached its home port so an engine engine for his purposes must produce light at all times edison had installed his historic first great central station system in new york on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two -wire
