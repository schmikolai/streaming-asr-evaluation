It is such a noble ambition that it is a pity it has usually such a shallow foundation. He wanted to begin at the top of the ladder. Philip, therefore, read diligently in the Astor Library, planned literary works that should compel attention, and nursed his genius. He had no friend wise enough to tell him to step into the dorking convention, then in session, make a sketch of the men and women on the platform, and take it to the editor of the Daily Grapevine, and see what he could get a line for it. Oh, very well, said Gringo, turning away with a shade of contempt. You'll find, if you are going into literature and newspaper work, thatâ€” You can't afford a conscience like that. But Philip did afford it, and he wrote, thanking his friends and declining because he said the political scheme would fail and ought to fail. And he went back to his books and to his waiting for an opening large enough for a signified entrance into the literary world. Well, I'm going as an engineer. You could go as one. You can begin by carrying a rod and putting down the figures. No, it's not too soon. I'd been ready to go anywhere for six months. The two young men, who were by this time full of the adventure, went down to the Wall Street office of Henry's uncle and had a talk with that wily operator. The night was spent in packing up and writing letters, for Philip would not take such an important step without informing his friends. Why, it's in Missouri somewhere, on the frontier, I think. We'll get a map. I was afraid it was nearer home. he knew his uncle would be glad to hear that he had at last turned his thoughts to a practical matter he well knew the perils of the frontier the savage state of society the lurking indians and the dangers of fever",4.77354621887207

It was quite true that a vessel was in sight, hardly more than six miles from the shore, but owing to the increase in the earth's convexity, and the consequent limitation of the range of vision, the rigging of the top masts alone was visible above the water, exclaimed Servadak, keeping his eye unmoved at his telescope. She is under sail, but she is Count Timoshef's yacht. he was right if the count were on board a strange fatality was bringing him to the presence of his rival he reckoned therefore not only upon ascertaining the extent of the late catastrophe but upon learning its cause the wind being adverse the dobrina did not make very rapid progress but as the weather in spite of a few clouds remained calm and the sea was quite smooth she was enabled to hold a steady course Cervidac took it for granted that the Dobrina was endeavoring to put in. A narrow channel formed a passage through the ridge of rocks that protected it from the open sea, and which, even in the roughest weather, would ensure the calmness of its waters. Slightly changing her course, she first struck her mainsail, and in order to facilitate the movements of her helmsman, soon carried nothing but her two topsails, Brigantine and Jib. Captain Servidac hastened toward him. I left you on a continent, and here I have the honor of finding you on an island. Nothing more than you know yourself. Are you certain that this is the Mediterranean? For some moments he seemed perfectly stupefied. And then, recovering himself, he began to overwhelm the Count with a torrent of questions. To all these inquiries the Count responded in the affirmative. Some mysterious force seemed to have brought about a convulsion of the elements. You will take me on board, Count, will you not? My yacht is at your service, sir, even should you require to make a tour around the world. The Count shook his head. Before starting, it was indispensable that the engine of the Dobrina should be repaired. To sail under canvas only would, in contrary winds and rough seas, be both tedious and difficult. it was on the last day of january that the repairs of the schooner were completed a slight diminution in the excessively high temperature which had prevailed for the last few weeks was the only apparent change in the general order of things but whether this was to be attributed to any alteration in the earth's orbit was a question which would still require several days to decide doubts now arose and some discussion followed whether or not it was desirable for Ben Zuth to accompany his master.",3.6141517162323

All my danger and sufferings were needed to strike a spark of human feeling out of him. But now that I am well, his nature has resumed its sway. You seem anxious, my uncle, I said, seeing him continually with his glass to his eye. Anxious? One might be. with less reason than now. I am not complaining that the rate is slow, but that the sea is so wide. We are losing time, and the fact is, I have not come all this way to take a little sail upon a pond on a raft. He called this sea a pond, and I long voyage taking a little sail. Therefore, don't talk to me about views and prospects. I take this as my answer, and I leave the professor to bite his lips with impatience. sunday august sixteenth nothing new weather unchanged the wind freshens but there seemed no reason of fear the shadow of the raft was clearly outlined upon the surface of the waves truly the sea is of infinite width it must be as wide as the mediterranean or the atlantic and why not these thoughts agitated me all day and my imagination scarcely calmed down after several hours sleep I shudder as I recall these monsters to my remembrance. I saw at the Hamburg Museum the skeleton of one of these creatures, thirty feet in length. I suppose Professor Liedenbrock was of my opinion too, and even shared my fears. For after having examined the pig, his eyes traversed the ocean from side to side. Tuesday, August 18th. During his watch, I slept. Two hours afterwards, a terrible shock awoke me. The raft was heaved up on a watery mountain and pitched down again at a distance of twenty fathoms. There's a whale, a whale, cried the professor. Flight was out of the question now. The reptiles rose. They wheeled around our little raft with a rapidity greater than that of express trains. Two monsters only were creating all this commotion, and before my eyes are two reptiles of the primitive world. I can distinguish the eye of the ichthyosaurus, glowing like a red-hot coal and as large as a man's head. Its jaw is enormous, and according to naturalists, it is armed with no less than 182 teeth. Those huge creatures attacked each other with the greatest animosity. Suddenly, the ichthyosaurus and the plesiosaurus disappear below, leaving a whirlpool eddying in the water.

Tis late, and I go myself within a short space. As any in England, I would say, said Gamewell proudly. that is, in his day. Yet he will teach you a few tricks when morning is come. There was no chance to alter his sleeping-room to one nearer to Gamewell's chamber. Presently he crossed the floor of his room with decided step. Will, cried he softly, and Stutley, who had chosen his couch across the door of his young master's chamber, sprang up at once in answer. We will go out together to the bower. There's a way down to the court from my window. Rest and be still until I warn you. The hours passed wearily by, and movement could yet be heard about the hall. At last all was quiet and black in the courtyard of Gamewell. Will, whispered Robin, opening his door as he spoke, are you ready?

From the blackness behind the light they heard a voice, Warrington's. Save me, masters, but you startled me rarely, cried he, waving the lanthorn before him to make sure that these were no ghosts in front of him, inquired Robin, with his suspicion still upon him. Truly such a horse would be worth much in nodding him fair. Nay, nay, lording, answered Warrington with a half-laugh. Warrington spoke thus with significance, to show Robin that he was not to think Jeffrey's claims to the estate would be passed by. Robin Fitzuth saw that his doubts of Warrington had been unfair, and he became ashamed of himself for harboring them. His tones rang pleasantly on Warrington's ears, and forthwith a good fellowship was heralded between them. the old servant told him quietly as they crept back to gainwell that this passageway led from the hut in the pleasance to sherwood and that geoffrey for the time was hiding with the outlaws in the forest he implores us to be discreet as the grave in this matter for in sooth his life is in the hollow of our hands they regain their apartment apparently without disturbing the household of gainwell",4.91813588142395

First, as a Paris stockbroker, later as a celebrated author and yachtsman, he went on frequent voyages to Britain, America, the Mediterranean. Nemo builds a fabulous futuristic submarine, the Nautilus, then conducts an underwater campaign of vengeance against his imperialist oppressor. In all, the novel had a difficult gestation. Other subtleties occur inside each episode, the textures sparkling with wit, information, and insight. His specifications for an open-sea submarine and a self-containing diving suit were decades before their time, yet modern technology bears them out triumphantly. Even the supporting cast is shrewdly drawn. Professor Aranax, the career scientist caught in an ethical conflict. Concey, the compulsive classifier who supplies humorous taglines for Vern's fast facts. The harpooner Ned Land, a creature of constant appetites, man as heroic animal. But much of the novel's brooding power comes from Captain Nemo. This compulsion leads Nemo into ugly contradictions. He is a fighter for freedom, yet all who board his ship are imprisoned there for good. He works to save lives, both human and animal, yet he himself creates a holocaust. He detests imperialism, yet he lays personal claim to the South Pole. And in this last action, he falls into the classic sin of pride. He is swiftly punished. The Nautilus nearly perishes in the Antarctic, and Nemo sinks into a growing depression. For many, then, this book has been a source of fascination, surely one of the most influential novels ever written, and inspiration for such scientists and discoverers as engineer Simon Lake, oceanographer William Beebe, polar traveler Sir Ernest Shackleton.

3570-5694-0000,0.08143322475570032," But already at a point in economic evolution far ante-dating the emergence of the lady, specialized consumption of goods, as an evidence of pecuniary strength, had begun to work out in a more or less elaborate system. The utility of consumption, as an evidence of wealth, is to be classed as a derivative of growth. Such consumption as falls to the women is merely incidental to their work. It is a means to their continued labor, and not a consumption directed to their own comfort and fullness of life. With a further advance in culture, this taboo may change into simple custom of a more or less rigorous character, but whatever be the theoretical basis of the distinction which is maintained, whether it be a taboo or a larger conventionality, the features of the conventional scheme of consumption do not change easily. In the nature of things, luxuries and the comforts of life belong to the leisure class. Under the taboo, certain victuals, and more particularly, certain beverages, are strictly reserved for the use of the superior class. Drunkenness and the other pathological consequences of the free use of stimulants therefore tend in their turn to become honorific, as being a mark at the secondary move of the superior status of those who are able to afford the indulgence. It has even happened that the name for certain diseased conditions of the body arising from such an origin has passed into everyday speech as a synonym for noble or gentle. The consumption of luxuries, in the true sense, is a consumption directed to the comfort of the consumer himself, and is, therefore, a mark of the master. With many qualifications, with more qualifications as the patriarchal tradition has gradually weakened, the general rule is felt to be right and binding that women should consume only for the benefit of their masters. The objection, of course, presents itself that expenditure on women's dress and household paraphernalia is an obvious exception to this rule, but it will appear in the sequel that this exception is much more obvious than substantial. the custom of festive gatherings probably originated in motives of conviviality and religion these motives are also present in the later development but they do not continue to be the sole motives there is a more or less elaborate system of rank and grades this differentiation is furthered by the inheritance of wealth and the consequent inheritance of gentility many of these affiliated gentlemen of leisure are at the same time lesser men of substance in their own right so that some of them are scarcely at all others only partially to be rated as vicarious consumers so many of them however as make up the retainer and hangers-on of the patron may be classed as vicarious consumer without qualification the wearing of uniforms or liveries implies a considerable degree of dependence and may even be said to be a mark of servitude real or ostensible The wearers of uniforms and liveries may be roughly divided into two classes, the free and the servile, or the noble and the ignoble. But the general distinction is not on that account to be overlooked. So, those offices which are by right the proper employment of the leisure class are noble, such as government, fighting, hunting, the care of arms and accoutrements, and the like. In short, those which may be classed as ostensibly predatory employments. Whenever, as in these cases, the menial service in question has to do directly with the primary leisure employments of fighting and hunting, it easily acquires a reflected honorific character. The livery becomes obnoxious to nearly all who are required to wear it.",4.870146751403809
3570-5695-0000,0.05664488017429194," In a general way, though not wholly nor consistently, these two groups coincide. The dependent who was first delegated for these duties was the wife, or the chief wife, and, as would be expected in the later development of the institution, when the number of persons by whom these duties are customarily performed gradually narrows, the wife remains the last. But as we descend the social scale, the point is presently reached, where the duties of vicarious leisure and consumption devolve upon the wife alone. in the communities of the western culture this point is at present found among the lower middle class if beauty or comfort is achieved and it is a more or less fortuitous circumstance if they are they must be achieved by means and methods that commend themselves through the great economic law of wasted effort The man of the household also can do something in this direction, and indeed he commonly does, but with a still lower descent into the levels of indigence, along the margin of the slums, the man, and presently also the children, virtually cease to consume valuable goods for appearances, and the woman remains virtually the sole exponent of the household's pecuniary decency. Very much of squalor and discomfort will be endured before the last trinket or the last pretense of pecuniary decency is put away. There is no class and no country that has yielded so abjectly before the pressure of physical want as to deny themselves all gratification of this higher or spiritual need. The question is, which of the two methods will most effectively reach the persons whose convictions it is desired to affect? Each will therefore serve about equally well during the earlier stages of social growth. The modern organization of industry works in the same direction also by another line. It is evident, therefore, that the present trend of the development is in the direction of heightening the utility of conspicuous consumption as compared with leisure. It is also noticeable that the serviceability of consumption as a means of repute, as well as the insistence on it as an element of decency, is at its best in those portions of the community where the human contact of the individual is widest and the mobility of the population is greatest. consumption becomes a larger element in the standard of living in the city than in the country among the country population its place is to some extent taken by savings and home comforts known through the medium of neighbourhood gossip sufficiently to serve the like general purpose of pecuniary repute the result is a great mobility of the labour employed in printing perhaps greater than in any other equally well-defined and considerable body of workmen",3.361020565032959

I am not depreciating it when I say that in these times it is not rare, but it is not with a view to distinction that you should cultivate this talent, if you consult your own happiness. You will say that a woman has no need of such a caution. There can be no peril in it for her. The more she is engaged in her proper duties, the less leisure will she have for it, even as an accomplishment and a recreation. To those duties you have not yet been called, and when you are, you will be less eager for celebrity. But do not suppose that I disparage the gift which you possess. nor that I would discourage you from exercising it. I only exhort you so to think of it, and so to use it, as to render it conducive to your own permanent good. Farewell, madame. Though I may be but an ungracious advisor, you will allow me, therefore, to subscribe myself with the best wishes for your happiness, here and hereafter, your true friend, Robert Selvey. Sir, March 16th. I have not ventured to hope for such a reply, so considerate in its tone, so noble in its spirit. I know the first letter I wrote to you is all senseless trash from beginning to end, but I am not altogether the idle, dreaming being it would seem to denote. I thought it therefore my duty, when I left school, to become a governess. In the evenings, I confess, I do think, but I never trouble anyone else with my thoughts. I carefully avoid any appearance of preoccupation and eccentricity, which might lead those I live amongst to suspect the nature of my pursuits. I don't always succeed, for sometimes when I'm teaching or sewing I would rather be reading or writing, but I try to deny myself, and my father's approbation amply rewarded me for the privation. Again I thank you. This incident, I suppose, will be renewed no more. If I live to be an old woman, I shall remember it thirty years hence as a bright dream. I cannot deny myself the gratification of inserting Southey's reply. Keswick, March 22, 1837 Dear Madame, Your letter has given me great pleasure, and I should not forgive myself if I did not tell you so. Of this second letter also she spoke, and told me that it contained an invitation for her to go and see the poet if ever she visited the lakes. On August 27, 1837, she writes, Come, come, I'm getting really tired of your absence. Saturday after Saturday comes around, and I can have no hope of hearing your knock at the door, and then being told that Miss E has come. Oh dear, in this monotonous life of mine, that was a pleasant event. I wish it would recur again, but it will take two or three interviews before the stiffness, the estrangement of this long separation will wear away. my eyes fill with tears when i contrast the bliss of such a state brightened by hopes of the future with the melancholy state i now live in uncertain that i ever felt true contrition wandering in thought and deed longing for holiness which i shall never never obtain smitten at times to the heart with the conviction that ghastly calvinistic doctrines are true darkened in short by the very shadows of spiritual death If Christian perfection be necessary to salvation, I shall never be saved. My heart is a very hotbed for sinful thoughts, and when I decide on an action, I scarcely remember to look to my Redeemer for direction. And meantime, I know the greatness of Jehovah. I acknowledge the perfection of His word. I adore the purity of the Christian faith. My theory is right, my practice horribly wrong. The Christmas holidays came, and she and Anne returned to the parsonage, and to that happy home circle in which alone their natures expanded. Amongst all other people, they shriveled up more or less. Indeed, there were only one or two strangers who could be admitted among the sisters without producing the same result. She was gone out into the village on some errand when, as she was descending the steep street, her foot slipped on the ice and she fell. It was dark, and no one saw her mischance, till after a time her groans attracted the attention of a passerby. Unfortunately, the fracture could not be set till six o'clock the next morning, as no surgeon was to be had before that time. And she now lies at our house in a very doubtful and dangerous state. However, remembering what you told me, namely that you had commended the matter to a higher decision than ours, and that you were resolved to submit with resignation to that decision, whatever it might be. I hold it my duty to yield also and to be silent, and may be all for the best. After this disappointment, I never dare reckon with certainty on the enjoyment of a pleasure again. It seems as if some fatality stood between you and me. I am not good enough for you, and you must be kept from the contamination of too intimate society. A good neighbor of the Brontes, a clever, intelligent Yorkshire woman who keeps a druggish shop in Haworth, from her occupation her experience in excellent sense, holds the position of village doctress and nurse, and as such has been a friend in many a time of trial and sickness and death in the households round, told me a characteristic little incident Tabby had lived with them for ten or twelve years and was, as Charlotte expressed it, one of the family. He refused at first to listen to the careful advice. It was repugnant to his liberal nature. This decision was communicated to the girls. Tabby had tended them in their childhood. They and none other should tend her in her infirmity and age. At tea time they were sad and silent and the meal went away untouched by any of the three. She had another weight on her mind this Christmas. But Anne had begun to suffer just before the holidays, and Charlotte watched over her younger sisters with a jealous vigilance of some wild creature that changes her very nature if danger threatens her young. Stung by anxiety for this little sister, she upbraided Miss W. for her fancied indifference to Anne's state of health. Still, her heart had received a shock in the perception of Anne's delicacy. and all these holidays she watched over her with the longing fawn anxiety which is so full of sudden pangs of fear i doubt whether branwell was maintaining himself at this time",13.935779094696045

Beholding it, Hester was constrained to rush towards the child, to pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably began, to snatch her to her bosom. with a close pressure and earnest kisses, not so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that Pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive. Brooding over all these matters, the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit, but, by some irregularity in the process of conjuration, has failed to win the master word that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence. Pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world. Pearl saw and gazed intently, but never sought to make acquaintance. If spoken to, she would not speak again.",3.4357709884643555

Actor-managers nod to him, editors allow him to contribute, without charge, to a symposium on the price of golf balls. In short, he becomes a prominent figure in London's society, and, if he is not careful, somebody will say so. But even the unsuccessful dramatist has his moments. Your play must be not merely a good play, but a successful one. Frankly, I cannot always say. But suppose you said, I'm fond of writing. My people always say my letters home are good enough for punch. I've got a little idea for a play about a man, and a woman, and another woman, and, but perhaps I better keep the plot a secret for the moment. Anyhow, it's jolly exciting, and I can do the dialogue all right. Lend me your ear for ten minutes, and you shall learn just what stagecraft is. And I should begin with a short homily on Now, the object of this soliloquy is plain. Indeed, irresolution being the keynote of Hamlet's soliloquy, a clever player could to some extent indicate the whole thirty lines by a silent working of the jaw. But, at the same time, it would be idle to deny that he would miss the finer shades of the dramatist's meaning. We moderns, however, see the absurdity of it. If it be granted, first, that the thoughts of a certain character should be known to the audience, and secondly, that soliloquy, or the habit of thinking aloud, is in opposition to modern stage technique, how shall soliloquy be avoided without damage to the play? And so on, till you get to the end when Ophelia might say, Ah, yes, or something non-committal of that sort. This would be an easy way of doing it, but it would not be the best way, for the reason that it is too easy to call attention to itself. In the old, badly made play, it was frequently necessary for one of the characters to take the audience into his confidence.

And sometimes you will find me referring to them as colorists, sometimes as chiaroscurists. By being studious of color, they are studious of division. And while the chiaroscurist devotes himself to the representation of degrees of force in one thing, unseparated light, the colorists have for their function the attainment of beauty by arrangement of the divisions of light.

Some of the touches, indeed, when the tint has been mixed with much so that the pigment might crystallize hard at the edge. It is the head of a parrot with a little flower in his beak from a picture of Carpaccio's, one of his series of the life of St. George. Then he comes to the beak of it. The brown ground beneath is left for the most part. One touch of black is put for the hollow, two delicate lines of dark gray define the outer curve, and one little quivering touch of white draws the inner edge of the mandible. For, believe me, the final philosophy of art can only ratify their opinion that the beauty of a cock-robin is to be red, and of a grass plot to be green, and the best skill of art is in instantly seizing on the manifold deliciousness of light, which you can only seize by precision of instantaneous touch. Now you will see in these studies that the moment the white is enclosed properly and harmonized with the other hues, it becomes somehow more precious and pearly. than the white paper and that i am not afraid to leave a whole field of untreated white paper all round it being sure that even the little diamonds in the round window will tell as jewels if they are gradated justly but in this vignette copied from turner you have the two principles brought out perfectly they are beyond all other works that i know existing dependent for their effect on low subdued tones Their favorite choice in time of day being either dawn or twilight, and even their brightest sunsets produced chiefly out of gray paper. It may be that a great colorist will use his utmost force of color as a singer his full power of voice, but, loud or low, the virtue is in both cases always in refinement, never in loudness. It must, remember, be one or the other. think that the Gothic school is an easy one. The law of that school is that everything shall be seen clearly, or at least only in such mist or faintness as shall be delightful. And I have no doubt that the best introduction to it would be the elementary practice of painting every study on a golden ground. This at once compels you to understand that the work is to be imaginative and decorative, that it represents beautiful things in the clearest way, but not under existing conditions. and that, in fact, you are producing jeweler's work rather than pictures. That a style is restrained or severe does not mean that it is also erroneous. In all early Gothic art, indeed, you will find failure of this kind, especially distortion and rigidity, which are in many respects painfully to be compared with the splendid repose of classic art. The large letter contains, indeed, entirely feeble and ill-drawn figures. That is merely childish and failing work of an inferior hand. It is not characteristic of Gothic, or any other school. But, observe, you can only do this on one condition, that of striving also to create, in reality, the beauty which you seek in imagination. It will be wholly impossible for you to retain the tranquility of temper and felicity of faith necessary for noble, purest painting. unless you are actively engaged in promoting the felicity and peace of practical life. You must look at him in the face, fight him, conquer him, with what scathe you may. You need not think to keep out of the way of him. The colorist says, first of all, as my delicious parquet was ruby, so this nasty viper shall be black. And then is the question, can I round him off? even though he is black, and make him slimy, and yet springy and close down, clotted like a pool of black blood on the earth, all the same? Nothing will be more precious to you, I think, in the practical study of art, than the conviction, which will force itself on you more and more every hour, of the way all things are bound together, little and great, in spirit and in matter. You know I've... Just been telling you how this school of materialism and clay involved itself at last in cloud and fire. Here is an equally typical Greek school landscape by Wilson. Lost wholly in golden mist. The trees so slightly drawn that you don't know if they are trees or towers. And no care for color whatsoever. Perfectly deceptive and marvelous effect of sunshine through the mist. Apollo and the python. Now here is Raphael. exactly between the two trees still drawn leaf by leaf wholly formal but beautiful mist coming gradually into the distance well then last here is turner's greek school of the highest class and you define his art absolutely as first the displaying intensely and with the sternest intellect of natural form as it is and then the envelopment of it with cloud and fire There are two sorts of cloud and fire. He knows them both. There's one and there's another, the Dudley and the Flint. It is only a pencil outlined by Edward Byrne Jones in illustration of the story of Psyche. It is the introduction of Psyche after all her troubles sent to heaven. Every plant in the grass is set formally, grows perfectly, and may be realized completely. exquisite order and universal with eternal life and light this is the faith and effort of the schools of crystal and you may describe and complete their work quite literally by taking any verses of Chaucer in his tender mood and observing how he insists on the clearness and brightness first and then on the order thus in Chaucer's dream in both these high mythical subjects the surrounding nature those suffering is still dignified and beautiful. But now here is the subject of which you will wonder at first why Turner drew it at all. It has no beauty whatsoever, no specialty of picturesqueness, and all its lines are cramped and poor. The crampedness and the poverty are all intended. It is a gleaner bringing down her one sheaf of corn to an old watermill, itself mossy and rent, scarcely able to get its stones to turn. The scene is absolutely Arcadian. See that your lives be in nothing worse than a boy's climbing for his entangled kite.",13.627800941467285

I had again been acting under the influence of this man's power. Perchance, too, Kaffir's death might serve him in good stead. My tongue refused to articulate. My power of speech left me.

And he was dumbfounded, I can tell you, when he saw it was nobody but Anders. He was such a big boy that he wore high boots and carried a jackknife. Now, this knife was a splendid one, though half the blade was gone and the handle was a little cracked. And Anders knew that one is almost a man as soon as one has a jackknife. Yes, why not, thought Anders, seeing that I am so fine, I may as well go and visit the king. I am going to the court ball, answered Anders. And she took Anders' hand and walked with him up the broad marble stairs, where soldiers were posted at every third step. and through the magnificent halls where courtiers in silk and velvet stood bowing wherever he went for like as not they must have thought him a prince when they saw his fine cap at the farther end of the largest hall a table was set with golden cups and golden plates in long rows on huge silver platters were pyramids of tarts and cakes and red wine sparkled in glittering decanters the princess sat down under a blue canopy with bouquets of roses and she let anders sit in a golden chair by her side but you must not eat with your cap on your head she said and was going to take it off the princess certainly was beautiful and he would have dearly liked to be kissed by her but the cap which his mother had made he would not give up on any condition he only shook his head well but now said the princess and she filled his pockets with cakes and put her own heavy gold chain around his neck and bent down and kissed him that is a very fine cap you have he said so it is said anders and it is made of mother's best yarn and she knitted it herself, and everybody wants to get it away from me. With one jump, Anders got out of his chair. He darted like an arrow through all the halls, down all the stairs, and across the yard. He still held on to it with both hands as he rushed into his mother's cottage. And all his brothers and sisters stood round and listened with their mouths open. But when his big brother heard that he had refused to give his cap for a king's golden crown, he said that Anders was a stupid. Anders' face grew red, but his mother hugged him close. No, my little son, she said, if you dressed in silk and gold from top to toe, you could not look any nicer than in your little red cap.",3.8399782180786133

The only duplicate which existed, so far as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is absolutely above suspicion. The moment I looked at my table, I was aware that someone had rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had left them all together. The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the papers. I gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while I made a most careful examination of the room.

While the former foretold that the Scottish Covenanters were secretly forming a union with the English Parliament, and inculcated the necessity of preventing them by some vigorous that every such attempt would precipitate them into measures to which otherwise they were not perhaps inclined. The king's ears were now open to Montrose's counsels, who proposed none but the boldest and most daring, agreeably to the desperate state of the royal cause in Scotland. five hundred men more who had been levied by the covenanters were persuaded to embrace the royal cause and with this combined force he hastened to attack lord elko who lay at perth with an army of six thousand men assembled upon the first news of the irish invasion dreading the superior power of argyle who having joined his vassals to a force levied by the public was approaching with a considerable army montrose hastened northward in order to rouse again the marquis of huntly and the gordons who having before hastily taken arms had been instantly suppressed by the covenanters was very low for military prowess, and after some skirmishes in which he was worsted, he here allowed Montrose to escape him. By quick marches through these inaccessible mountains, that general freed himself from the superior forces of the Covenanters. With these, and some reinforcements of the Athol men and MacDonalds, whom he had recalled, Montrose fell suddenly upon Argyle's country, and let loose upon it all the rage of war, carrying off the cattle, burning the houses, and putting the inhabitants to the sword. This severity by which Montrose sullied his victories was the result of private animosity against the chieftain, as much as of zeal for the public cause. argyle collecting three thousand men marched in quest of the enemy who had retired with their plunder and he lay at inner locky supposing himself still at a considerable distance from them by a quick and unexpected march montrose hastened to inner locky and presented himself in order of battle before the surprised but not affrightened covenanters his conduct and presence of mind in this emergence appeared conspicuous montrose weak in cavalry here lined his troops of horse with infantry and after putting the enemy's horse to rout fell with united force upon their foot who were entirely cut in pieces though with the loss of the gallant lord gordon on the part of the royalists from the same men new regiments and new companies were formed different officers appointed and the whole military force put into such hands as the independents could rely on besides members of parliament who were excluded many officers unwilling to serve under the new generals threw up their commissions and unwarily facilitated the project of putting the army entirely into the hands of that faction though the discipline of the former parliamentary army was not contemptible a more exact plan was introduced, and rigorously executed by these new commanders. Valour, indeed, was very generally diffused over the one party as well as the other. During this period, discipline also was attained by the forces of the Parliament, but the perfection of the military art in concerting the general plans of action and the operations of the field seems still on both sides to have been in a great measure wanting historians at least perhaps from their own ignorance and inexperience have not remarked anything but a headlong impetuous conduct each party hurrying to a battle where valor and fortune chiefly determine the success",7.139776229858398

Robin and the little tumbler between them tried to force the squire to stand back, and very valiantly did these two comport themselves. The head and chief of the riot, the Nottingham Apprentice, with clenched fists, threatened Montfichet. The squire helped to thrust them all in and entered swiftly himself. Now be silent on your lives, he began, but the captured apprentice set up an instant shout. Silence, you knave, cried Montfichet. He felt for and found the wizard's black cloth. The squire was quite out of breath. Thrusting open the proper entrance of the tent, Robin suddenly rushed forth with his burden with a great shout. A Montfichet! A Montfichet! Gamewell to the rescue! Taking advantage of this, the squire's few men redoubled their efforts, and, encouraged by Robin's and the little stroller's cries, fought their way to him. George Montfichet will never forget this day. What is your name, lording? asked the little stroller presently. Robin Fitzuth. And mine is Will Stutley. Shall we be comrades? Write willingly, for between us we have won the battle, answered Robin. I like you, Will. You are the second, Will, that I have met and liked within two days. Is there a sign in that?

Pray follow us, with mine and my lord sheriff's men. Nottingham Castle was reached, and admittance was demanded. Master Monceau, the sheriff of Nottingham, was mightily put about when told of the rioting, and Henry might return to England at any moment. ""'Have your will, child, if the boy also wills it,' Montfichet answered, feeling too ill to oppose anything very strongly just then.

8230-279154-0000,0.08164915117219078," The analysis of knowledge will occupy us until the end of the thirteenth lecture, and is the most difficult part of our whole enterprise. What is called perception differs from sensation by the fact that the sensational ingredients bring up habitual associates, images and expectations of their usual correlates, all of which are subjectively indistinguishable from the sensation. Whether or not this principle is liable to exceptions, everyone would agree that it has a broad measure of truth, though the word exactly might seem an overstatement, and it might seem more correct to say that ideas approximately represent impressions. And what sort of evidence is logically possible? There is no logical impossibility in the hypothesis that the world sprang into being five minutes ago. exactly as it then was, with a population that remembered a wholly unreal past. All that I am doing is to use its logical tenability as a help in the analysis of what occurs when we remember. The behaviorist who attempts to make psychology a record of behavior has to trust his memory in making the record. habit is a concept involving the occurrence of similar events at different times if the behaviorist feels confident that there is such a phenomenon as habit that can only be because he trusts his memory when it assures him that there have been other times but i do not think such an inference is warranted our confidence or lack of confidence in the accuracy of a memory image must in fundamental cases be based upon a characteristic of the image itself, since we cannot evoke the past bodily and compare it with the present image. We sometimes have images that are by no means peculiarly vague, which yet we do not trust. For example, under the influence of fatigue, we may see a friend's face vividly and clearly, but horribly distorted. Some images, like some sensations, feel very familiar, Familiarity is a feeling capable of degrees. In an image of a well-known face, for example, some parts may feel more familiar than others. When this happens, we have more belief in the accuracy of the familiar parts than in that of the unfamiliar parts. I come now to the other characteristic which memory images must have in order to account for our knowledge of the past. They must have some characteristic, which makes us regard them as referring to more or less remote portions of the past. In actual fact, there are doubtless various factors that concur in giving us the feeling of greater or less remoteness in some remembered event. There may be a specific feeling, which could be called the feeling of pastness, especially where immediate memory is concerned. There is, of course, a difference between knowing the temporal relation of a remembered event to the present and knowing the time order of two remembered events. It would seem that only rather recent events can be placed at all accurately by means of feelings giving their temporal relation to the present. But it is clear that such feelings must play an essential part in the process of dating remembered events. if we had retained the subject or act in knowledge the whole problem of memory would have been comparatively simple remembering has to be a present occurrence in some way resembling or related to what is remembered some points may be taken as fixed and such as any theory of memory must arrive at in this case as in most others what may be taken as certain in advance is rather vague the first of our vague but indubitable data is that there is knowledge of the past we might provisionally though perhaps not quite correctly define memory as that way of knowing about the past which has no analogue in our knowledge of the future such a definition would at least serve to mark the problem with which we are concerned though some expectations may deserve to rank with memory as regards immediacy This distinction is vital to the understanding of memory, but it is not so easy to carry out in practice as it is to draw in theory. A gramophone, by the help of suitable records, might relate to us the incidents of its past, and people are not so different from gramophones as they like to believe. I can set to work now to remember things I never remembered before, such as what I had to eat for breakfast this morning. And it can hardly be holy habit that enables me to do this. The fact that a man can recite a poem does not show that he remembers any previous occasion on which he has recited or read it. Simmons' two books, mentioned in an earlier lecture, do not touch knowledge memory at all closely. They give walls according to which images of past occurrences come into our minds, but do not discuss our belief that these images refer to past occurrences. which is what constitutes knowledge memory. It is this that is of interest to theory of knowledge. It is by no means always reliable. Almost everybody has, at some time, experienced the well-known illusion that all that is happening now happened before at some time. Whenever the sense of familiarity occurs without a definite object, it leads us to search the environment until we are satisfied that we have found the appropriate object, which leads us to the judgment. This is familiar. Thus, no knowledge as to the past is to be derived from the feeling of familiarity alone. A further stage is recognition. does not necessarily involve more than a habit of association. The kind of object we are seeing at the moment is associated with the word cat, or with an auditory image of purring, or whatever other characteristic we may happen to recognize in the cat of the moment. We are, of course, in fact, able to judge when we recognize an object that we have seen it before, but this judgment is something over and above recognition in this first sense, and may very probably be impossible to animals that nevertheless have the experience of recognition in this first sense of the word. This knowledge is memory in one sense, though in another it is not. several points in which such an account of recognition is inadequate. To begin with, it might seem at first sight more correct to define recognition as, I have seen this before, than as, this has existed before. The definition of my experience is difficult. Broadly speaking, it is everything that is connected with what I am experiencing now by certain links, of which the various forms of memory are among the most important. Thus, if I recognize a thing, the occasion of its previous existence, in virtue of which I recognize it, forms part of my experience, by definition. Recognition will be one of the marks by which my experience is singled out from the rest of the world. Of course, the words, this has existed before, are a very inadequate translation of what actually happens when we form a judgment of recognition. but that is unavoidable words are framed to express a level of thought which is by no means primitive and are quite incapable of expressing such an elementary occurrence as recognition",11.955412864685059
672-122797-0000,0.19199272065514103," Out in the woods stood a nice little fir-tree. The place he had was a very good one. The sun shone on him. As to fresh air, there was enough of that. And round him grew many large-sized comrades, pines as well as firs. He did not think of the warm sun and of the fresh air. He did not care for the little cottage children that ran about and prattled when they were in the woods looking for wild strawberries, but this was what the tree could not bear to hear. In winter, when the snow lay glittering on the ground, a hare would often come leaping along and jump right over the little tree. Oh, that made him so angry! To grow and grow! to get older and be tall, thought the tree. That, after all, is the most delightful thing in the world. In autumn the woodcutters always came and felled some of the largest trees. This happened every year, and the young fir tree that had now grown to a very comely size trembled at the sight. For the magnificent great trees fell to the earth with noise and cracking, the branches were lopped off, and the trees looked long and bare. They were hardly to be recognized. And then they were laid in carts, and the horses dragged them out of the wood. Have you not met them anywhere? rejoice in thy growth said the sunbeams and then what happens then i would fain know if i am destined for so glorious a career cried the tree rejoicing i am now tall and my branches spread like the others that were carried off last year oh were i but already on the cart were i in the warm room with all the splendour and magnificence Yes, and something better, something still grander, will surely follow. Or wherefore should they thus ornament me? Something better, something still grander, must follow. But what? Rejoice in our presence, said the air and the sunlight. Rejoice in thy own fresh youth. But the tree did not rejoice at all. He grew and grew and was green both winter and summer, and towards Christmas he was one of the first that was cut down. The axe struck deep into the very pith. The tree fell to the earth with a sigh. He felt a pang. It was like a swoon. He could not think of happiness, for he was sorrowful at being separated from his home, from the place where he had sprung up. he well knew that he should never see his dear old comrades the little bushes and flowers around him any more perhaps not even the birds the departure was not at all agreeable the tree only came to himself when he was unloaded in a courtyard with the other trees and heard a man say that one is splendid we don't want the others there too were large easy-chairs silken sofas large tables full of picture-books and full of toys worth hundreds and hundreds of crowns at least the children said so the servants as well as the young ladies decorated it this evening they all said how it will shine this evening perhaps the other trees from the forest will come to look at me It blazed up famously. Help! Help! cried the young ladies, and they quickly put out the fire. A story! A story! cried the children, drawing a little fat man towards the tree. But I shall tell only one story. Humpy Dumpy fell downstairs, and yet he married the princess. That's the way of the world, thought the fir tree, and believed it all. because the man who told the story was so good-looking well well i won't tremble to-morrow thought the fir tree and the whole night the tree stood still and in deep thought in the morning the servant and the housemaid came in but they dragged him out of the room and up the stairs into the loft and here in a dark corner Where no daylight could enter, they left him. What's the meaning of this? thought the tree, and he leaned against the wall, lost in reverie. Time enough had he, too, for his reflections, for days and nights passed on, and nobody came up. And when at last somebody did come, it was only to put some great trunks in a corner out of the way. ""'Tis now winter, out of doors,' thought the tree. ""'How kind man is, after all! ""'If it only were not so dark here and so terribly lonely!' ""'Squeak! ""'Squeak!' They snuffed about the fir-tree and rustled among the branches. ""'I am by no means old,' said the fir-tree. ""'There's many a one considerably older than I am.' They were so extremely curious. ""'I know no such place,' said the tree. And then he told all about his youth. And the little mice had never heard the like before, and they listened and said,' said the fir-tree, thinking over what he had himself related. Yes, in reality, those were happy times. Who is Humpy Dumpy? asked the mice. Only that one, answered the tree. It is a very stupid story. Don't you know one about bacon and tallow candles? Can't you tell any larder stories? No, said the tree. At last the little mice stayed away also, and the tree sighed. After all, it was very pleasant when the sleek little mice sat round me and listened to what I told them. Now that, too, is over. Why, one morning there came a quantity of people and set to work in the loft. The trunks were moved, the tree was pulled out and thrown. rather hard, it is true, down on the floor. But a man drew him towards the stairs where the daylight shone. But it was not the fir-tree that they meant. It was in a corner that he lay, among weeds and nettles. The golden star of tinsel was still on the top of the tree and glittered in the sunshine. In the courtyard some of the merry children were playing who had danced at Christmas round the fir-tree, and were so glad at the sight of him. And the gardener's boy chopped the tree into small pieces. There was a whole heap lying there. The wood flamed up splendidly under the large brewing copper, and it sighed so deeply. However, that was over now. The tree gone. The story at an end.",13.010197162628174
8455-210777-0000,0.10251954821894005," I remained there alone for many hours, but I must acknowledge that before I left the chambers, I had gradually brought myself to look at the matter in another light. On arriving at home at my own residence, I found that our salon was filled with a brilliant company. As I spoke, I made him a gracious bow, and I think I showed him by my mode of address that I did not bear any grudge as to my individual self. We have our little struggles here as elsewhere. and all things cannot be done by Rosewater. We are quite satisfied now, Captain Battleaxe, said my wife. Quite satisfied, said Eva. The ladies, in compliance with that softness of heart, which is their characteristic, are on one side, and the men, by whom the world has to be managed, are on the other. No doubt, in process of time, the ladies will follow. I did not mean, said Captain Battleaxe, to touch upon public subjects at such a moment as this. Jack had been standing in the far corner of the room talking to Eva, and was now reduced to silence by his praises. Sir Kennington Oval is a very fine player, said my wife. I, and my wife and son, and the two Crestwellers, and three or four others, agreed to dine on board the ship on the next. This, I felt, was paid to me as being President of the Republic. and I endeavored to behave myself with such mingled humility and dignity as might befit the occasion. But I could not but feel that something was wanting to the simplicity of my ordinary life. My wife, on the spur of the moment, managed to give the gentleman a very good dinner. This, she said, was true hospitality, and I am not sure that I did not agree with that. Then there were three or four leading men of the community with their wives, who were for the most part the fathers and mothers of the young ladies. Oh, yes, said Jack, and I'm nowhere, but I mean to have my innings before long. We sat with the officer some little time after dinner, and then went ashore. How much of evil, of real accomplished evil, had there not occurred to me during the last few days? What could I do now but just lay myself down and die? When this captain should have taken himself and his vessel back to England, I would retire to a small farm, which I possessed at the furthest side of the island, and there in seclusion would I end my days. Jack would become Eva's happy husband, and would remain amidst the hurried duties of the eager world. Thinking of all this, I went to sleep. You have received us with all that courtesy and hospitality for which your character in England stands so high. It is a duty, said I, but your power is so superior to any that I can advance as to make us here feel that there is no disgrace in yielding to it. Not a doubt, but had your force been only double or trouble our own, I should have found it my duty to struggle with you. I can afford to smile because I am absolutely powerless before you. But I do not, the less, feel that in a matter of which the progress of the world is concerned, I, or rather we, have been put down by brute force. You have come to us threatening us with absolute destruction. Therefore, I feel myself quite able, as President of this Republic, to receive you with a courtesy due to the servants of a friendly ally. I can assure you, he has not even allowed me to see the trigger. since I have been on board. Then, said Sir Ferdinando, there is nothing for it but that we must take you with him. There came upon me a sudden shock when I heard these words, which exceeded anything which I had yet felt. You hear what Sir Ferdinando Brown has said, replied Captain Battleaxe. But what is the delicate mission, I asked. I was to be taken away and carried to England, or elsewhere, or drowned upon the voyage, it mattered not which. Then the Republic of Britain, Eula, was to be declared as non-existent, and the British flag was to be exalted, and a British governor installed in the executive chambers. You may be quite sure it's there, said Captain Battleaxe, and that I can so use it as to half-obliterate your town within two minutes of my return on board. You propose to kidnap me, I said. What would become of your gun were I to kidnap you? lieutenant cross trees is a very gallant officer one of us always remains on board while the other is on shore what worldwide iniquity such a speech as that discloses said i still turning myself to the captain for though i would have crushed them both by my words had it been possible my dislike centered itself on sir ferdinando you will allow me to suggest said he that that is a matter of opinion Were I to comply with your orders without expressing my own opinion, I should seem to have done so willingly hereafter. The letter ran as follows. Sir, I have it in command to inform your excellency that you have been appointed governor of the crown colony, which is called Britannula. The peculiar circumstances of the colony are within your excellency's knowledge, but in their selection of a constitution, The Briton Eulists have unfortunately allowed themselves but one deliberate assembly, and hence has sprung their present difficulties. It is founded on the acknowledged weakness of those who survived that period of life at which men ceased to work. But it is surmised that you will find difficulties in the way of your entering at once upon your governor. The John Bright is armed with a weapon of great power, against which it is impossible that the people of Briton Eula should prevail. When do you intend that the John Bright shall start? Today, I shouted. And I have no one ready to whom I can give up the archives of the government. I shall be happy to take charge of them, said Sir Ferdinando. They, of course, must all be authored, or of the habits of our people. It is quite impossible. Your power is sufficient, I said. If you will give us your promise to meet Captain Adelax here at this time tomorrow, We will stretch a point and delay the departure of the John Bright for 24 hours. And this plan was adopted too, in order to extract from me a promise that I would depart in peace.",11.910218715667725
4077-13751-0000,0.14345991561181434," On the 6th of April, 1830, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally organized and thus took on a legal existence. Its origin was small, a germ, an insignificant seed, hardly to be thought of as likely to arouse opposition. Instead of but six regularly affiliated members, and at most two score of adherents, the organization numbers today many hundred thousand souls. In place of a single hamlet, in the smallest corner of which the members could have congregated, there now are about 70 stakes of Zion and about 700 organized wards, each ward and stake with its full complement of officers and priesthood organizations. The practice of gathering its proselytes into one place prevents the building up and strengthening of foreign branches, and inasmuch as extensive and strong organizations are seldom met with abroad, very erroneous ideas exist concerning the strength of the church nevertheless the mustard seed among the smallest of all seeds has attained the proportions of a tree and the birds of the air are nesting in its branches the acorn is now an oak offering protection and the sweets of satisfaction to every earnest pilgrim journeying its way for truth their eyes were from the first turned in anticipation toward the evening sun not merely that the work of proselyting should be carried on in the West, but that the headquarters of the Church should be there established. The Book of Mormon had taught the people the true origin and destiny of the American Indians, and toward this dark-skinned remnant of a once mighty people, the missionaries of Mormonism early turned their eyes, and with their eyes went their hearts and their hopes. It is notable that the Indian tribes have generally regarded the religion of the Latter-day Saints with favor, seeing in the Book of Mormon striking agreement with their own traditions. The first well-established seat of the church was in the pretty little town of Kirtland, Ohio, almost within sight of Lake Erie. And here soon rose the first temple of modern times. To the fervent Latter-day Saint, a temple is not simply a church building, a house for religious assembly. soon thousands of converts had rented or purchased homes in missouri independence jackson county being their center but from the first they were unpopular among the missourians the lieutenant governor littleburn w boggs afterward governor was a pronounced mormon hater and throughout the period of the troubles he manifested sympathy with the persecutors Most of the refugees found shelter among the more hospitable people of Clay County, and afterward established themselves in Caldwell County, therein founding the city of Far West. A small settlement had been founded by Mormon families on Shoal Creek, and here on the 30th of October, 1838, a company of 240 fell upon the hapless settlers and butchered a score. Be it said to the honor of some of the officers entrusted with a terrible commission. that when they learned its true significance they resigned their authority rather than have anything to do with what they designated a cold-blooded butchery oh what a record to read what a picture to gaze upon how awful the fact american schoolboys read with emotions of horror of the albigenses driven beaten and killed with a papal legate directing the butchery and of the vaudois hunted and hounded like beasts, as the effect of a royal decree. And they yet shall read in the history of their own country, of scenes as terrible as these, in the exhibition of injustice and inhuman hate. Who began the quarrel? Was it the Mormons? As a sample of the press comments against the brutality of the Missourians, I quote a paragraph from the Quincy Argus, March 16, 1839. It will be observed that an organized mob, aided by many of the civil and military officers of Missouri, with Governor Boggs at their head, have been the prominent actors in this business, incited, too, it appears, against the Mormons by political hatred, and by the additional motives of plunder and revenge.",5.868752479553223

As the chase drives away, Mary stands bewildered and perplexed on the doorstep, her mind in a tumult of excitement in which hatred of the doctor, distrust, and suspicion of her mother disappointment, vexation, and ill-humor surge and swell among those delicate organizations on which the structure and development of the soul so closely depend, doing perhaps an irreparable injury. The mother, as soon as the chase is so far turned that Mary can no longer watch the expression of her countenance, goes away from the door with a smile of complacency and satisfaction on her face at the ingenuity and success of her little artifice. So you will be a good girl, I know, and not make any trouble, but will stay at home contentedly, won't you? The mother, in managing the case in this way, relies partly on convincing the reason of the child, and partly on an appeal to her affection. If you should not be a good girl, but should show signs of making us any trouble. I shall have to send you out somewhere to the back part of the house until we are gone. But this last supposition is almost always unnecessary, for if Mary has been habitually managed on this principle, she will not make any trouble.

I did not wrong myself so, but I placed a wrong on thee. When called before, I told how hastily I dropped my flowers or break off from a game. Shall I never miss home talk and blessing? and the common kiss that comes to each in turn, nor count it strange when I look up to drop on a new range of walls and floors another home than this. Alas! I have grieved, so I am hard to love. Open thy heart wide, and fold within the wet wings of thy dove. Could it mean, to last, a love set pendulous between sorrow and sorrow? Nay!

Then I, long tried by natural ills, received the comfort fast, While budding at thy sight my pilgrim's staff Gave out green leaves with morning dews empearled.

He had preconceived ideas about everything, and his idea about Americans was that they should be engineers or mechanics. It's tremendously well put on, too. It's been on only two weeks, and I've been half a dozen times already. Do you know, Alexander, Main Hall looked with perplexity up into the top of the handsome and rubbed his pink cheek with his gloved finger. Do you know, I sometimes think of taking to criticism seriously myself. She saves her hand, too. She's at her best in the second act. He's been wanting to marry Hilda these three years and more. She doesn't take up with anybody, you know. Irene Burgoyne, one of her family, told me in confidence that there was a romance somewhere back in the beginning. Mainhall vouched for her constancy with a loftiness that made Alexander smile, even while a kind of rapid excitement was tingling through him. He's another who's awfully keen about her. Let me introduce you. Sir Harry Towne, Mr. Bartley Alexander, the American engineer. I say, Sir Harry, the little girl's going famously tonight, isn't she?

He was beginning to feel a keen interest in the slender, barefoot donkey girl who slipped in and out of the play, singing like someone winding through a hilly field. One night, when he and Winifred were sitting together on the bridge, He told her that things had happened while he was studying abroad, that he was sorry for, one thing in particular, and he asked her whether she thought she ought to know about them. She considered for a moment and then said, No, I think not, though I am glad you asked me. After that, it was easy to forget, actually to forget. Of course, he reflected, she always had that combination of something homely and sensible and something utterly wild and daft.

But in truth... Pearl was the one as well as the other, and only in consequence of that identity had Hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance. Come, therefore, and let us fling mud at them. But Pearl, who was a dauntless child, after frowning, stamping her foot, and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures, suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies, and put them all to flight. she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times They approached the door, which was of an arched form, and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice, in both of which were lattice windows, the wooden shutters to close over them at need. Yea, his honorable worship is within, but he hath a godly minister or two with him, and likewise a leech. Ye may not see his worship now. With many variations, suggested by the nature of his building materials, diversity of climate, and a different mode of social life, Governor Bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of Ferris State in his native land. On the table, in token that the sentiment of old English hospitality had not been left behind, stood a large pewter tankard, at the bottom of which, had Hester or Pearl peeped into it, they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draft of ale. Little Pearl, who was as greatly pleased with the gleaming armor as she had been with the glittering frontispiece of the house, spent some time looking into the polished mirror of the breastplate. Mother, cried she, I see you here. Look, look. In truth, she seemed absolutely hidden behind it. pearl accordingly ran to the bow window at the further end of the hall and looked along the vista of a garden walk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening There were a few rose bushes, however, and a number of apple trees, probably the descendants of those planted by the Reverend Mr. Blackstone, the first settler of the peninsula, that half-mythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull. Pearl, seeing the rose bushes, began to cry for a red rose and would not be pacified.",6.942523956298828
2830-3980-0000,0.07360861759425494," In every way, they sought to undermine the authority of St. Paul. They said to the Galatians, You have no right to think highly of Paul. He was the last to turn to Christ. Paul came later and is beneath us. Indeed, he persecuted the Church of Christ for a long time. Do you suppose that God, for the sake of a few Lutheran heretics, would disown his entire Church? Against these boasting false apostles, Paul boldly defends his apostolic authority in ministry. as the ambassador of a government is honored for his office and not for his private person so the minister of christ should exalt his office in order to gain authority among men paul takes pride in his ministry not to his own praise but to the praise of god either he calls ministers through the agency of men or he calls them directly as he called the prophets and apostles paul declares that the false apostles were called or sent neither by men nor by man The most they could claim is that they were sent by others. He mentions the apostles first because they were appointed directly by God. The call is not to be taken lightly. For a person to possess knowledge is not enough. It spoils one's best work. When I was a young man, I thought Paul was making too much of his call. I did not then realize the importance of the ministry. I knew nothing of the doctrine of faith because we were taught sophistry instead of certainty, and nobody understood spiritual boasting. This is no sinful pride, it is holy pride. And God the Father who raised him from the dead. The clause seems superfluous on first sight. These perverters of the righteousness of Christ resist the Father and the Son and the works of them both. In this whole epistle, Paul treats of the resurrection of Christ. By his resurrection, Christ won the victory over law, sin, flesh, world, devil, death, hell, and every evil. Verse 2. and all the brethren which are with me. This should go far in shutting the mouths of the false apostles. Although the brethren with me are not apostles like myself, yet they are all of one mind with me, think, write, and teach as I do. They do not go where the enemies of the gospel predominate. They go where the Christians are. Why do they not invade the Catholic provinces and preach their doctrine to godless princes, bishops, and doctors, as we have done by the help of God? We look for that reward which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man. Not all the Galatians had become perverted. These means cannot be contaminated. They remain divine regardless of men's opinion. Wherever the means of grace are found, there is the Holy Church, even though Antichrist reigns there. So much for the title of the epistle now follows the greeting of the Apostle. Verse 3 Grace be to you, and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ. The terms of grace and peace are common terms with Paul, and are now pretty well understood. The greeting of the Apostle is refreshing. Grace involves the remission of sins, peace, and a happy conscience. The world brands this a pernicious doctrine. Experience proves this. However, the grace and peace of God will. Men should not speculate about the nature of God. Was it not enough to save from God the Father? To do so is to lose God altogether because God becomes intolerable when we seek to measure and to comprehend His infinite majesty. He came down to earth, lived among men, suffered, was crucified, and then he died, standing clearly before us, so that our hearts and eyes may fasten upon him. Embrace him, and forget about the nature of God. Did not Christ himself say, I am the way, and the truth, and the life? No man cometh unto the Father but by me? When you argue about the nature of God, apart from the question of justification, you may be as profound as you like. We are to hear Christ, who has been appointed by the Father as our divine teacher. At the same time, Paul confirms our creed that Christ is very God. That Christ is very God is apparent in that Paul ascribes to him divine powers equally with the Father, as, for instance, the power to dispense grace and peace. To bestow peace and grace lies in the province of God, who alone can create these blessings. The angels cannot. Otherwise, Paul should have written, Grace from God the Father and peace from our Lord Jesus Christ. The Arians took Christ for a noble and perfect creature, superior even to the angels, because by him God created heaven and earth. Muhammad also speaks highly of Christ. Paul sticks to his theme. He never loses sight of the purpose of his epistle. Not gold or silver or paschal lambs or an angel, but himself. What for? Not for a crown, or a kingdom, or our goodness, but for our sins. Underscore these words, for they are full of comfort for sore consciences. How may we obtain remission of our sins? Paul answers, the man who is named Jesus Christ and the Son of God gave himself for our sins. Since Christ was given for our sins, it stands to reason that they cannot be put away by our own efforts. This sentence also defines our sins as great, so great, in fact, that the whole world could not make amends for a single sin. The greatness of the ransom, Christ, the Son of God, indicates this. The vicious character of sin is brought out by the words, who gave himself for our sins. But we are careless. We make light of sin. We think that by some little work or merit we can dismiss sin. This passage, then, bears out the fact that all men are sold under sin. This attitude springs from a false conception of sin, the conception that sin is a small matter, easily taken care of by good works, that we must present ourselves unto God with a good conscience, that we must feel no sin before we may feel that Christ was given for our sins. This attitude is universal and particularly developed in those who consider themselves better than others. But the real significance and comfort of the words, for our sins, is lost upon them. On the other hand, we are not to regard them as so terrible that we must despair.",12.256773710250854
4446-2275-0000,0.078125," The stop at Queenstown, the tedious passage up the Mercy, were things that he noted dimly through his growing impatience. She blushed and smiled and fumbled his card in her confusion before she ran upstairs. Alexander paced up and down the hallway, buttoning and unbuttoning his overcoat, until she returned and took him up to Hilda's living room. The room was empty when he entered. ""'Alexander did not sit down. ""'I felt it in my bones when I woke this morning ""'that something splendid was going to turn up. ""'I thought it might be Sister Kate or Cousin Mike ""'would be happening along. ""'She pushed him toward the big chair by the fire ""'and sat down on a stool at the opposite side of the hearth, ""'her knees drawn up to her chin, ""'laughing like a happy little girl. ""'When did you come, Bartley, and how did it happen? ""'You haven't spoken a word.' ""'I got in about ten minutes ago.' ""'Alexander leaned forward and warmed his hands before the blaze. Bartley bent lowered over the fire. She looked at his heavy shoulders and big, determined head, thrust forward like a catapult in leash. ""'I'll do anything you wish me to, Bartley,' she said tremulously. ""'I can't stand seeing you miserable.' He pulled up a window as if the air were heavy. Hilda watched him from the corner, trembling and scarcely breathing, dark shadows growing about her eyes. ""'But it's worse now. It's unbearable. I get nothing but misery out of either.' The world is all there, just as it used to be, but I can't get at it any more. It was myself I was defying Hilda. Hilda's face quivered, but she whispered, Yes, I think it must have been. But why didn't you tell me when you were here in the summer? Alexander groaned. I meant to, but somehow I couldn't. She pressed his hand gently in gratitude. Weren't you happy then, at all? She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, as if to draw in again the fragrance of those days. He moved uneasily, and his chair creaked. Yes, yes, she hurried, pulling her hand gently away from him. Please tell me one thing, Bartley. At least tell me that you believe I thought I was making you happy. Yes, Hilda, I know that, he said simply. I understand, Bartley. I was wrong, but I didn't know. You've only to tell me now. What I mean is that I want you to promise never to see me again, no matter how often I come, no matter how hard I beg. Keep away if you wish. When have I ever followed you? Alexander rose and shook himself angrily. Yes, I know I'm cowardly. He took her roughly in his arms. Do you know what I mean? Oh, Bartley, what am I to do? I will ask the least imaginable, but I must have something. I must know about you. ""'The sight of you, Bartley, to see you living and happy and successful, can I never make you understand what that means to me? You see, loving someone as I love you makes the whole world different. And then you came back, not caring very much, but it made no difference.' Bartley bent over and took her in his arms, kissing her mouth and her wet, tired eyes. ""'Don't cry, don't cry,' he whispered. ""'We've tortured each other enough for to-night.'",5.224049806594849

The ideas also remain, but they have become types in nature, forms of men, animals, birds, fishes. The style and plan of the Tineas differ greatly from that of any other of the Platonic dialogues. but plato has not the same mastery over his instrument which he exhibits in the phaedrus or symposium nothing can exceed the beauty or art of the introduction in which he is using words after his accustomed manner but in the rest of the work the power of language seems to fail him and the dramatic form is wholly given up he could write in one style but not in another and the greek language has not as yet been fashioned by any poet or philosopher to describe physical phenomena and hence we find the same sort of clumsiness in the timaeus of plato which characterizes the philosophical poem of lucretius there is a want of flow and often a defect of rhythm the meaning is sometimes obscure and there is a greater use of apposition and more of repetition than occurs in plato's earlier writings plato had not the command of his materials which would have enabled him to produce a perfect work of art",5.2199273109436035
5639-40744-0000,0.1449056603773585," Eleven o'clock had struck. It was a fine, clear night. They were the only persons on the road. And they sauntered leisurely along, to avoid paying the price of fatigue for the recreation provided for the Toledans in the valley or on the banks of their river. Secure, as he thought, in the careful administration of justice in that city, and the character of its well-disposed inhabitants, the good Hidalgo was far from thinking that any disaster could befall his family. rudolfo and his companions with their faces muffled in their cloaks stared rudely and insolently at the mother the daughter and the servant-maid in a moment he communicated his thoughts to his companions and in the next moment they resolved to turn back and carry her off to please rudolfo for the rich who are open-handed always find parasites ready to encourage their bad propensities and thus to conceive this wicked design to communicate it approve it, resolve on Ravish and Laocadia, and to carry that design into effect was the work of a moment. They drew their swords, hid their faces in the flaps of their cloaks, turned back, and soon came in front of the little party, who had not yet done giving thanks to God for their escape from those audacious men. Finally the one party went off exalting, and the other was left in and Leocadia's parents reached theirs, heartbroken and despairing. Meanwhile, Rudolfo had Leocadia safe in his custody, and in his own apartment. Who touches me? Am I in bed? Mother, dear father, do you hear me? It is the only amends I ask of you for the wrong you have done me. She found the door, but it was locked outside. She succeeded in opening the window, and the moonlight shone in so brightly that she could distinguish the color of some damask hanging in the room. she saw that the bed was gilded and so rich that it seemed that of a prince rather than of a private gentleman among other things on which she cast her eyes was a small crucifix of solid silver standing on a cabinet near the window this person was rudolpho who though he had gone to look for his friends had changed his mind in that respect not thinking it advisable to acquaint them with what had passed between him and the girl on the contrary he resolved to tell them that repenting of his violence and moved by her tears he had only carried her half way towards his house and then let her go choking with emotion leocadia made a sign to her parents that she wished to be alone with them that would be very well my child replied her father if your plan were not liable to be frustrated by ordinary cunning but no doubt this image had been already missed by its owner and he will have set it down for certain that it was taken out of the room by the person he locked up there what you had best do my child is to keep it and pray to it that since it was a witness to your undoing it will deign to vindicate your cause by its righteous judgment thus did the humane and right-minded father comfort his unhappy daughter and her mother, embracing her again, did all she could to soothe the feelings. She, meanwhile, passed her life with her parents in the strictest retirement, never letting herself be seen, but shunning every eye lest it should read her misfortune in her face. Time rolled on. The hour of her delivery arrived. It took place in the utmost secrecy, her mother taking upon her the office of midwife, as she gave birth to a son, one of the most beautiful ever seen. when the boy walked through the streets blessings were showered upon him by all who saw him blessing upon his beauty upon the mother that bore him upon the father that begot him upon those who brought him up so well one day when the boy was sent by his grandfather with a message to a relation he passed along a street in which there was a great concourse of horsemen the bed she too well remembered was there and above all the cabinet on which had stood the image she had taken away was still on the same spot. Louis was out of danger in a fortnight. In a month he rose from his bed, and during all that time he was visited daily by his mother and grandmother, and treated by the master and mistress of the house as if he was their own child. This truth, which I have learned from her lips, is confirmed by his face, in which we have both beheld that of our son. Just then Leocadia came to herself. And embracing the cross seemed changed into a sea of tears, and the gentleman remaining in utter bewilderment, until his wife had repeated to him, from beginning to end, Leocadia's whole story, and he believed it, through the blessed dispensation of heaven which had confirmed it by so many convincing testimonies. So persuasive were her entreaties, and so strong her assurances that no harm whatever could result to them, from the information she sought. they were induced to confess that one summer's night the same she had mentioned themselves and another friend being out on a stroll with rodolpho they had been concerned in the abduction of a girl whom rodolpho carried off whilst the rest of them detained her family who made a great outcry and would have defended her if they could for god's sake my lady mother give me a wife who would be an agreeable companion not one who will disgust me, so that we may both bear evenly and with mutual goodwill, the yoke imposed on us by heaven, instead of pulling this way and that way, and fretting each other to death. Her bearing was graceful and animated. She led her son by the hand, and before her walked two maids, with wax lights and silver candlesticks. All rose to do her reverence, as if something from heaven had miraculously appeared before them. but gazing on her entranced with admiration not one of them was able to address a single word to her she reflected how near she stood to the crisis which was to determine whether she was to be blessed or unhappy for ever and racked by the intensity of her emotions she suddenly changed color her head dropped and she fell forward in a swoon into the arms of the dismayed estephania his mother had left her to him as being her destined protector but when she saw that he too was insensible she was near making a third and would have done so had he not come to himself know then son of my heart that this fainting lady is your real bride i say real because she is the one whom your father and i have chosen for you and the portrait was a pretense just at the moment when the tears of the pitying beholders flowed fastest and their ejaculations were most expressive of despair leocadia gave signs of recovery and brought back gladness to the hearts of all this was done for the event took place at a time when the consent of the parties was sufficient for the celebration of a marriage without any of the preliminary formalities which are now so properly required nor was rodolpho less surprised than they and the better to assure himself of so wonderful a fact he begged leocadia to give him some token which should make perfectly clear to him that which indeed he did not doubt, since it was authenticated by his parents.",11.118462324142456

Someone else told a story not particularly effective, which I saw he was not following, cried one of the women. He took no notice of her. He looked at me, but as if, instead of me, he saw what he spoke of. There was a unanimous groan at this, and much reproach, after which, in his preoccupied way, he explained, The story's written. I could write to my man and enclose the key. He could send down the packet as he finds it. The others resented postponement, but it was just his scruples that charmed me. To this his answer was prompt. Oh, thank God, no. And is the record yours? ""'She would have been worthy of any whatever. ""'It wasn't simply that she said so, but that I knew she hadn't. ""'I was sure. I could see. ""'You'll easily judge why when you hear. ""'Because the thing had been such a scare?' ""'He continued to fix me. ""'You are acute.'

The first of these touches conveyed that the written statement took up the tale at a point after it had, in a manner, begun. He had for his own town residence a big house filled with the spoils of travel and the trophies of the chase. But it was to his country home, an old family place in Essex, that he wished her immediately to proceed. The awkward thing was that they had practically no other relations. and that his own affairs took up all his time. There were plenty of people to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess would be in supreme authority. I don't anticipate. She was young, untried, nervous. It was a vision of serious duties and little company, of really great loneliness. Yes, but that's just the beauty of her passion. It was the beauty of it. It sounded dull, but sounded strange, and all the more so because of his main condition, which was, she promised to do this, and she mentioned to me that when for a moment, disburdened, delighted, he held her hand, thanking her for the sacrifice, she already felt rewarded. But was that all her reward? one of the ladies asked.",5.309452295303345

Ah, very well. Let him come in, then, said the king. and as if colbert had been listening at the door for the purpose of keeping himself au courant with the conversation he entered as soon as the king had pronounced his name to the two courtiers gentlemen do your posts whereupon saint haignan and villeroy took their leave certainly sire but i must have money to do that what what do you mean inquired louise he has given them with too much grace not to have others still to give if they are required which is the case at the present moment. It is necessary, therefore, that he should comply. The king frowned. Does your majesty, then, no longer believe the disloyal attempt? Not at all. You are, on the contrary, most agreeable to me. Your majesty's plan, then, in this affair is, you will take them from my private treasure. The news circulated with the rapidity of lightning. During its progress, it kindled every variety of coquetry, desire, and wild ambition. The king had completed his toilet by nine o'clock. He appeared in an open carriage decorated with branches of trees and flowers. The queens had taken their seats upon a magnificent dais or platform erected upon the borders of the lake in a theater of wonderful elegance of construction. Suddenly, for the purpose of restoring peace and order, Spring, accompanied by his whole court, made his appearance. The seasons, allies of spring, followed him closely to form a quadrille, which, after many words of more or less flattering import, was the commencement of the dance. His legs, the best shaped at court, were displayed to great advantage in flesh-colored silken hose, a silk so fine and so transparent that it seemed almost like flesh itself. there was something in his carriage which resembled the buoyant movements of an immortal and he did not dance so much as seemed to soar along yes it is suppressed far from it sire your majesty having given no directions about it the musicians have retained it yes sire and ready dressed for the ballet sire he said your majesty's most devoted servant approaches to perform a service on this occasion with similar zeal that he has already shown on the field of battle the king seemed only pleased with everyone present monsieur was the only one who did not understand anything about the matter the ballet began the effect was more than beautiful when the music by its bursts of melody carried away these illustrious dancers When the simple, untutored pantomime of that period, only the more natural on account of the very indifferent acting of the august actors, had reached its culminating point of triumph, the theater shook with tumultuous applause. Disdainful of a success of which Madame showed no acknowledgment, he thought of nothing but boldly regaining the marked preference of the princess. By degrees all his happiness, all his brilliancy, subsided into regret and uneasiness, so that his limbs lost their power, his arms hung heavily by his sides, and his head drooped as though he was stupefied. The king, who had from this moment become in reality the principal dancer in the quadrille, cast a look upon his vanquished rival.",5.166092395782471

Upon this, Madame deigned to turn her eyes languishingly towards the Comte, observing, Do you think so? she replied with indifference. yes the character which your royal highness assumed is in perfect harmony with your own explain yourself i allude to the goddess the princess inquired no she then rose humming the air to which she was presently going to dance the arrow pierced his heart and wounded him mortally a quarter of an hour afterwards he returned to the theatre But it will be readily believed that it was only a powerful effort of reason over his great excitement that enabled him to go back. Or perhaps, for love is thus strangely constituted, he found it impossible even to remain much longer separated from the presence of one who had broken his heart. When she perceived the young man, she rose, like a woman surprised in the midst of ideas she was desirous of concealing from herself. Remain, I implore you. The evening is most lovely. Indeed, ah, I remember now, and I congratulate myself. Do you love anyone? Forgive me, I hardly know what I am saying. A thousand times forgive me. Madame was right, quite right. This brutal exile has completely turned my brain. There cannot be a doubt he received you kindly, for, in fact, you returned without his permission. Oh, Mademoiselle. Why have I not a devoted sister or a true friend such as yourself? What, already here? they said to her. I have been here this quarter of an hour, replied Lavallier. Did not the dancing amuse you? No, no more than the dancing. Lavallier is quite a poetess, said Tonnet Charente. I am a woman, and there are few like me. Whoever loves me flatters me. Whoever flatters me pleases me. And whoever pleases, well, said Montelet, you do not finish. It is too difficult, replied Mademoiselle de Tannay-Charlotte, laughing loudly. Look, yonder, do you not see the moon slowly rising, silvering the topmost branches of the chestnuts and the oaks? Exquisite soft turf of the woods, the happiness which your friendship confers upon me. Well, said Mademoiselle de Tannay-Charlotte, I also think a good deal, but I take care. To say nothing, said Montalais, so that when Mademoiselle de Tonnet-Cherent thinks, Athene is the only one who knows it. Quick, quick, then, among the high reed grass, said Montalais. Stoop, Athene, you are so tall. The young girls had indeed made themselves small, indeed invisible. She was here just now, said the Count. You are positive, then? Yes, but perhaps I frightened her. in what way how is it lavalier said mademoiselle de tenechant that the vicomte de braga alone spoke of you as louise it seems the king will not consent to it good gracious has the king any right to interfere in matters of that kind i give my consent oh i am speaking seriously replied montalais and my opinion in this case is quite as good as the king's i suppose is it not louise Let us run, then, said all three, and gracefully lifting up the long skirts of their silk dresses, they lightly ran across the open space between the lake and the thickest covert of the park. In fact, the sound of madame's and the queen's carriages could be heard in the distance upon the hard, dry ground of the roads, followed by the mountain cavaliers.

The atmosphere is charged with vapors, pervaded with the electricity generated by the evaporation of saline waters. The electric light can scarcely penetrate through the dense curtain, which is dropped over the theater on which the battle of the elements is about to be waged. The air is heavy. The sea is calm. From time to time, a fleecy tuft of mist, with yet some gleaming light left upon it, drops down upon the dense floor of gray and loses itself in the opaque and impenetrable mass. The atmosphere is evidently charged and surcharged with electricity. The wind never lulls, but to acquire increased strength, the vast bank of heavy clouds is a huge reservoir of fearful, windy gusts and rushing storms. there's a heavy storm coming on i cried pointing towards the horizon those clouds seem as if they were going to crush the sea but if we have now ceased to advance why do we yet leave that sail loose which at the first shock of a tempest may capsize us in a moment that will be the safest no no never The piled-up vapors condensed into water, and the air, put into violent action to supply the vacuum left by the condensation of the mists, rouses itself into a whirlwind. Hans stirs not. From the undersurface of the clouds, there are continual emissions of lurid light. Electric matter is in continual evolution from their component molecules. The gaseous elements of the air need to be slaked with moisture. for innumerable columns of water rush upwards into the air and fall back again in white foam i refer to the thermometer it indicates the figure is obliterated is the atmospheric condition having once reached its density to become final the raft bears on still to the southeast at noon the violence of the storm redoubles each of us is lashed as some part of the raft the waves rise above our heads they seem to be we are lost but i am not sure he nods his consent the fireball half of it white half azure blue and the size of a ten inch shell move slowly about the raft but revolving on its own axis with astonishing velocity as if whipped round by the force of the whirlwind here it comes there it glides now it is up the ragged stump of the mast thence it lightly leaps on the provision bag descends with a light bound and just skims the powder magazine horrible we shall be blown up but no the dazzling disk of mysterious light nimbly leaps aside it approaches hans who fixes his blue eye upon it steadily it threatens the head of my uncle who falls upon his knees with his head down to avoid it A suffocating smell of nitrogen fills the air, it enters the throat, it fills the lungs.

In despair, he hurled himself downward too soon. The great hawk fouled hurriedly to retrieve his prey from the ground. The cat growled softly, picked up the prize in her jaws, and trotted into the bushes to devour it. in fact he had just finished it the last of the trout's tail had just vanished with a spasm down his strained gullet when the baffled hawk caught sight of him and swooped the hawk alighted on the dead branch and sat upright motionless as if surprised like his unfortunate little cousin the teal he too had felt the fear of death smitten into his heart and was heading desperately for the refuge of some dark overhanging bank deep fringed with weeds where the dreadful eye of the hawk should not discern him the hawk sat upon the branch and watched his quarry swimming beneath the surface almost instantly he was forced to the top straightway the hawk glided from his perch and darted after him But at this point in the rapids it was impossible for him to stay down. But this frequenter of the heights of air, for all his savage valor, was troubled at the leaping waves and the tossing foam of these mad rapids. He did not understand them. As he flew, his downreaching, clutching talons were not half a yard above the fugitive's head, where the waves for an instant sank. They came closer, but not quite within grasping reach. But, as before, the leaping waves of the rapids were too much for his pursuer, and he was able to flap his way onward in a cloud of foam, while doom hung low above his head, yet hesitated to strike. The hawk, embittered by the loss of his first quarry, had become as dogged in pursuit as a weasel, not to be shaken off, or evaded, or deceived. he had a lot of line-out and the place was none too free for a long cast but he was impatient to drop his flies again on the spot where the big fish was feeding the last drop fly as luck would have it caught just in the corner of the hawk's angrily open beak hooking itself firmly at the sudden sharp sting of it the great bird turned his head and noticed for the first time the fisherman standing on the bank the drag upon his beak and the light check upon his wings were inexplicable to him and appalling then the leader parted from the line",4.838561296463013

Two hundred warriors feasted in his hall and followed him to battle. The rest of you off a Viking. He had three ships. These he gave to three of my brothers. But I stayed that spring and built me a boat. I made her for only twenty oars because I thought few men would follow me, for I was young, fifteen years old. I painted the eyes red for anger. There, stand so, I said, and glare and hiss at my foes. In the stern I carved the tail up almost as high as the head. There she sat on the rollers, as fair a ship as I ever saw. Then I will get me a farm, and we'll winter in that land. Now who will follow me? He is but a boy, the man said. Thirty men, one after another, raised their horns and said, As our boat flashed down the rollers into the water, I made this song and sang it. So we harried the coast of Norway. We ate at many men's tables uninvited. My dragon's belly is never full, and on board went the gold. Oh, it is better to live on the sea and let other men raise your crops and cook your meals. A house smells of smoke, a ship smells of frolic. Up and down the water we went, to get much wealth and much frolic. What of the farm, Olaf? Not yet, I answered. Viking is better for summer. It was so dark that I could see nothing but a few sparks on the hearth. I stood with my back to the wall. for I wanted no sword reaching out of the dark for me. Come, come, I called, when no one obeyed. A fire! My men laughed. Yes, a stingy host! He acts as though he had not expected us. On a bench in a far corner were a dozen people huddled together. Bring in the table! We are hungry! The thralls were bringing in a great pot of meat. They set up a crane over the fire and hung the pot upon it, and we sat and watched it boil while we joked. At last the supper began. The farmer sat gloomily on the bench and would not eat, and you cannot wonder, for he saw us putting potfuls of his good beef and basket loads of bread into our big mouths. You would not eat with us. You cannot say no to half of my ale. I drink this to your health. Then I drank half of the hornful and set the rest across the fire to the farmer. He took it and smiled, saying, Did you ever have such a lordly guest before? i went on so i will give out this law that my men shall never leave you alone hawk in there shall be your constant companion friend farmer he shall not leave you day or night whether you are working or playing or sleeping i named nine others and said and these shall follow your thralls in the same way so i set guards over everyone in that house so no tails got out to the neighbors besides it was a lonely place and by good luck no one came that way Their eyes danced. Big Torleaf stood up and stretched himself. I'm stiff with long sitting, he said. I itch for a fight. I turned to the farmer. This is our last feast with you, I said. By the beard of Odin, I cried, you have taken our joke like a man. My men pounded the table with their fists. By the hammer of Thor, shouted Grimm, there is no stingy coward. Here, friend, take it, and he thrust it into the farmer's hand. May you drink heart's ease from it for many years, and with it I leave you a name, Sif the Friendly. I shall hope to drink with you sometime in Valhalla. Here is a ring for Sif the Friendly, and here is a bracelet, and a sword would not be ashamed to hang at your side. I took five great bracelets of gold from our treasure chest and gave them to him. That is the best way to decide, for the spear will always point somewhere, and one thing is as good as another. That time it pointed us into your father's ships. Here, they said, is a rascal who has been harrying our coasts. We sunk his ship and men, but him we brought to you. A robber viking, said the king, and he scowled at me. Yes, and with all your fingers it took you a year to catch me. The king frowned more angrily. Take him out, Torkel, and let him taste your sword. Your mother, the queen, was standing by. Now she put her hand on his arm and smiled and said, And would he not be a good gift for our baby? your father thought a moment then looked at your mother and smiled soft heart he said gently to her then to torkel well let him go torkel then he turned to me again frowning but young sharp-tongue now that we have caught you we will put you into a trap that you cannot get out of so i lived and now i am your tooth-thrall well it is the luck of war",7.593939542770386
3570-5696-0000,0.049315068493150684," Under the simple test of effectiveness for advertising, we should expect to find leisure and the conspicuous consumption of goods dividing the field of pecuniary emulation pretty evenly between them at the outset. But the actual course of development has been somewhat different from this ideal scheme. Leisure held the first place at the start and came to hold a rank very much above wasteful consumption of goods, both as a direct exponent of wealth and as an element in the standard of decency during the quasi-peaceful culture. Other circumstances permitting, that instinct disposes men to look with favour upon productive efficiency and on whatever is of human use. A reconciliation between the two conflicting requirements is effected by a resort to make-believe. Many an intricate polite observances and social duties of a ceremonial nature are developed. Many organizations are founded, with some specious object of amelioration embodied in their official style and title. There is much coming and going, and a deal of talk, to the end that the talkies may not have occasion to reflect on what is the effectual economic value of their traffic. The salient features of this development of domestic service have already been indicated. Throughout the entire evolution of conspicuous expenditure, whether of goods or of services or human life, runs the obvious implication that in order to effectually mend the consumer's good fame, it must be an expenditure of superfluities. As used in the speech of everyday life, the word carries an undertone of deprecation. The use of the word waste as a technical term, therefore, implies no deprecation of the motives or of the ends sought by the consumer under this canon of conspicuous waste. But it is on other grounds worth noting that the term waste in the language of everyday life implies deprecation of what is characterized as wasteful. In strict accuracy, nothing should be included under the head of conspicuous waste but such expenditure as is incurred on the ground of an invidious pecuniary comparison. An article may be useful and wasteful both, and its utility to the consumer may be made up of use and waste in the most varying proportions.",2.600346565246582

Slang is odious. Slang makes one shudder. Who denies that? Of course it does. When it is a question of probing a wound, a gulf, a society since when has it been considered wrong to go too far to go to the bottom we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted in fulfilled merits why should one not explore everything and study everything why should one halt on the way nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang now when has horror ever excluded study since when has malady banished medicine can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper the bat the scorpion the centipede the tarantula and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying oh how ugly that is he would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in language a philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact in humanity we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating it we may be told that all trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slang the painter who says my grinder the notary who says my skip the gutter the hairdresser who says my mealy back the cobbler who says my cub talks slang the sugar manufacturer who says loaf clarified lumps bastard common burnt this honest manufacturer talks slang To meet the needs of this conflict, wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is slang. To keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion, to hold above the gulf, were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost, or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself even dialect let that pass to this we reply in one word only assuredly if the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy is not a business in which choice is permitted he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable casemates where crawl pell-mell those who bleed and those who deal the blow, those who weep and those who curse, those who fast and those who devour, those who endure evil and those who inflict it.

One perceives, without understanding it, a hideous murmur, sounding almost like human accents, but more nearly resembling a howl than an articulate word. One thinks one hears hydras talking. it is unintelligible in the dark it is black in misfortune it is blacker still in crime these two blacknesses amalgamated compose slang the earth is not devoid of resemblance to a jail look closely at life it is so made that everywhere we feel the sense of punishment Each day has its own great grief for its little care. Yesterday you were trembling for a health that is dear to you. Today you fear for your own. Tomorrow it will be anxiety about money. The day after, tomorrow the diatribe of a slanderer. The day after that, the misfortune of some friend. Then the prevailing weather. Then something that has been broken or lost, then a pleasure with which your conscience and your vertebral column reproach you. Again, the course of public affairs, this without reckoning in the pains of the heart, and so it goes on. There is hardly one day out of a hundred which is wholly joyous and sunny, and you belong to that small class who are happy? In this world, evidently the vestibule of another, there are no fortunate. The real human division is this, the luminous and the shady. To diminish the number of the shady, to augment the number of the luminous, that is the object. That is why we cry education, science. To teach reading means to light the fire. Every syllable spelled out sparkles. However, he who says light does not necessarily say joy. People suffer in the light. Excess burns. The flame is the enemy of the wing. To burn without ceasing to fly. Therein lies the marvel of genius.",10.287532329559326

Then they all marched out a little way into the fields, and found that the army of pinkies had already formed, and was advancing steadily toward them. At the head of the pinkies were Gipka Sizzle and Button Bright, who had the parrot on his shoulder. and they were supported by Captain Coralie, and Captain Tintant, and Rosalie the Witch. When the blueskin saw Gipka Sizzle, they raised another great shout, for he was the favorite of the soldiers, and very popular with all the people. Since last Thursday, I, Gipka Sizzle, have been the lawful Boolaroo of the blue country, but now that you are conquered by Queen Trot, I suppose I am conquered too, and you have no Boolaroo at all. when he finished she said cheerfully don't worry sizzle dear it'll all come right pretty soon now then let's enter the city and enjoy the great feast that's being cooked i'm nearly starving myself for this conquering kingdoms is hard work then she gave rosalie back her magic ring thanking the kind witch for all she had done for them you are her mate replied the sailor it will be such a satisfaction The guards had a terrible struggle with the goat, which was loose in the room, and still wanted to fight, but finally they subdued the animal, and then they took the boularoo out of the frame who was tied in, and brought both him and the goat before Queen Trot, who awaited them in the throne room of the palace. I'll gladly do that, promised the new boularoo, and I'll feed the honorable goat all the shavings and leather and tin cans he can eat, besides the grass. ""'Excuse me,' said Trot.

At once the goat gave a leap, escaped from the soldiers, and with bowed head rushed upon the Bularoo. Before any could stop him, he butted his majesty so furiously that the king soared far into the air, and tumbled in a heap among the benches, where he lay moaning and groaning. the goat's warlike spirit was roused by this successful attack then they sped in great haste for the door and the goat gave a final butt that sent the row of royal ladies all diving into the corridor in another tangle whereupon they shrieked in a manner that terrified everyone within sound of their voices she said going toward the benches",4.046208620071411

For the oak table was usually turned up like a screen and was more for ornament than for use. And she could see herself sometimes in the great round pewter dishes that were arranged on the shelves above the long deal dinner table, or in the hobs of the grate, which always shone like Jasper. The family likeness between her and her niece dinah morris with the contrast between her keenness and dinah's seraphic gentleness of expression might have served a painter as an excellent suggestion for a martha and mary her tongue was not less keen than her eye and whenever a damsel came within earshot seemed to take up an unfinished lecture as a barrel organ takes up a tune precisely at the point where it had left off to all appearance molly had got through her after-dinner work in an exemplary manner had cleaned herself with great dispatch and now came to ask submissively if she should sit down to her spinning till milking time that's the road you'd all like to go headlongs to ruin mr oatley's indeed you are a rare'un for sitting down to your work a little while after it's time to put by money my iron's twight told please put it down to warm cold is it my darling bless your sweet face she's going to put the ironing things away money i did like to do into the barn to tommy to see the toddy however had descended from her chair with great swiftness and was already in retreat towards the dairy with a sort of waddling run and an amount of fat on the nape of her neck which made her look like the metamorphosis of a white suckling pig and she was very fond of you too aunt rachel i often heard her talk of you in the same sort of way when she had that bad illness and i was only eleven years old she used to say you'll have a friend on earth in your aunt rachel if I'm taken from you, for she has a kind heart, and I'm sure I've found it so. And there's linen in the house, as I could well spare you, for I got lots of sheeting and table clothing and toweling as isn't made up. But not more than what's in the Bible, Aunt, said Dinah. Nay, dear Aunt, you never heard me say that all people are called to forsake their work and their families. We can all be servants of God, wherever our lot is cast. but he gives us different sorts of work according as he fits us for it and calls us to it i can no more help spending my life in trying to do what i can for the souls of others than you could help running if you heard little toddy crying at the other end of the house the voice would go to your heart you would think the dear child was in trouble or in danger and you couldn't rest without running to help her and comfort her I have strong assurance that no evil will happen to you and my uncle and the children from anything I have done. I didn't preach without direction. Direction! I had a common patience with you. By this time the two gentlemen had reached the palings and had got down from their horses. It was plain they meant to come in, said Mr. Irwin, with his stately cordiality. I delight in your kitchen. Poyser is not at home, is he?

It was through Floyd's advice that Buchanan ordered the military expedition to Utah, ostensibly, to install certain federal officials and to repress an alleged infantile rebellion, which in fact had never come into existence, but in reality to further the interests of the secessionists. Moreover, had the people been inclined to rebellion, what greater opportunity could they have wished? Already a north and a south were talked of. Why not set up also a west? They knew no north, no south, no east, no west. They stood positively by the Constitution, and would have nothing to do in the bloody strife between brothers, unless indeed they were summoned by the authority to which they had already once loyally responded, to furnish men and arms for the country's need. What the Latter-day Saints call celestial marriage is characteristic of the Church, and is in very general practice. But of celestial marriage, plurality of wives was an incident, never an essential. We believe in a literal resurrection, and an actual hereafter, in which future states shall be recognized every sanctified and authorized relationship existing here on earth, of parent and child, brother and sister, husband and wife. It has been my privilege to tread the soil of many lands, to observe the customs and study the habits of more nations than one, and I have yet to find the place and meet the people where and with whom the purity of man and woman is held more precious than among the maligned Mormons in the mountain valleys of the West. At the inception of plural marriage among the Latter-day Saints, there was no law, national, or state against its practice. In 1862, a law was enacted with the purpose of suppressing plural marriage, and, as had been predicted in the National Senate prior to its passage, it lay for many years a dead letter. Federal judges and United States attorneys in Utah, who were not Mormons nor lovers of Mormonism, refused to entertain complaints or prosecute cases under the law because of its manifest injustice and inadequacy. This meant that for an alleged misdemeanor, for which Congress prescribed a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment and a fine of three hundred dollars. A man might be imprisoned for life, aye, for many terms of a man's natural life, did the court's power to enforce its sentences extend so far, and might be fined millions of dollars. Before this travesty on the administration of law could be brought before the court of last resort, and there met with the reversal and rebuke it deserved, Men were imprisoned under sentence of many years' duration. The people contested these measures one by one in the courts, presenting in case after case the different phases of the subject, and urging the unconstitutionality of the measure. Then the church was disincorporated, and its property both real and personal, confiscated and etiated to the government of the United States. And although the personal property was soon restored, real estate of great value long lay in the hands of the court's receiver, and the Mormon Church had to pay the national government high rental on its own property. And so the story of Mormonism runs on. Its finale has not yet been written. The current press presents continuously new stages of its progress, new developments of its plan.",4.70079493522644
6829-68769-0000,0.08843537414965986," Kenneth and Beth refrained from telling the other girls or Uncle John of old Will Rogers' visit, but they got Mr. Watson in the library and questioned him closely about the penalty for forging a check. It was a serious crime indeed, Mr. Watson told them, and Tom Gates bade fair to serve a lengthy term in the state's prison as a consequence of his rash act. I can't see it in that light, said the old lawyer. It was a deliberate theft from his employers to protect a girl he loved. But they could not have proven a case against Lucy, if she was innocent, and all their threats of arresting her were probably a mere bluff. He was soft-hearted and impetuous, said Beth, and being in love, he didn't stop to count the cost. If the prosecution were withdrawn, and the case settled with the victim of the forged check, then the young man would be allowed his freedom, but under the circumstances, I doubt if such an arrangement could be made. Fairview was twelve miles away, but by ten o'clock they drew up at the county jail. They were received in the little office by a man named Markham, who was the jailer. We wish to talk with him, answered Kenneth. Talk? I'm running for representative on the Republican ticket, said Kenneth quietly. Oh, say, that's different, observed Markham, altering his demeanor. Maybe see Gates at once, asked Kenneth. They followed the jailer along a succession of passages. Sometimes I'm that yearning for a smoke, I'm nearly crazy, and I don't know which is worse, dying one way or the other. He unlocked the door and called. Here's visitors, Tom. Worse, Tom, worse than ever, replied the jailer gloomily. Sorry, we haven't any reception room in the jail. Sit down, please, said Gates in a cheerful and pleasant voice. There's a bench here. A fresh, wholesome-looking boy was Tom Gates, with steady gray eyes, an intelligent forehead, but a sensitive, rather weak mouth. We have heard something of your story, said Kenneth, and are interested in it. I didn't stop to think whether it was foolish or not. I did it, and I'm glad I did it. Then Rogers wouldn't do anything but lead her around and wait upon her, and the place went to rack and ruin. He spoke simply, but paced up and down the narrow cell in front of them. Whose name did you sign to the check? asked Kenneth. He is supposed to sign all the checks of the concern. It's a stock company and rich. I was bitkeeper, so it was easy to get a blank check and forge the signature. As regards my robbing the company, I'll say that I saved him a heavy loss one day. I discovered and put out a fire that would have destroyed the whole plant, but Marshall never even thanked me. It was better for him to thank the girl unfeeling than to know the truth. I'm going to see Mr. Marshall, said Kenneth, and discover what I can do to assist you. Thank you, sir. It won't be much, but I'm grateful to find a friend. They left him then, for the jailer arrived to unlock the door and escort them to the office. I've seen lots of that kind in my day, and it ruins a man's disposition. He looked up rather ungraciously, but motioned them to be seated. Some girl has been in here twice to interview my men, and I have refused to admit her. I'm not electioneering just now. Oh, well, sir, what about him? And he deserves a term in state's prison. It has cost me twice sixty dollars in annoyance. I'll pay all the costs besides. You're foolish. Why should you do all this? I have my own reasons, Mr. Marshall. Give me a check for $150, and I'll turn over to you the forged check and quash further proceedings. He detested the grasping disposition that would endeavor to take advantage of his evident desire to help young Gates. Beth, uneasy at his silence, nudged him. There was a grim smile of amusement on his shrewd face. he might have had that forged check for the face of it if he'd been sharp and to think we can save all that misery and despair by the payment of a hundred and fifty dollars",5.98043417930603

Down by the river of Adonah her soft voice is heard, and thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew. O life of this our spring, why fades the lotus of the water? Why fade these children of the spring? Thel is like a watery bow, and like a parting cloud. Like a reflection in a glass, like shadows in the water, like dreams of infants, like a smile upon an infant's face, like the dove's voice, like transient day, like music in the air. Ah, and gentle sleep the sleep of death, and gently hear the voice of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time. The lily of the valley, breathing in the humble grass, answered the lovely maid and said, I am a watry weed, and I am very small, and love to dwell in lowly veils. So weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head, yet I am visited from heaven, and he that smiles on all walks in the valley, and each morn over me spreads his hand, saying, Rejoice, thou humble grass! Thou newborn lily flower, Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks, For thou shalt be clothed in light, And fed with morning manna, Till summer's heat melts thee beside The fountains and the springs, To flourish in eternal vales. They, why should Thel complain? Why should the mistress of the vales of Har utter a sigh? She ceased. and smiled in tears, then sat down in her silver shrine, which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs, revives the milked cow, and tames the fire-breathing steed, but thou is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun. I vanish from my pearly throne, and who shall find my place? And why it scatters its bright beauty through the humid air. Descend, O little cloud, and hover before the eyes of Thel. O little cloud, the virgin said, I charge thee to tell me why thou complainest now when in one hour thou fade away. Then we shall seek thee, but not find. Ah, Thel is like to thee. I pass away, yet I complain, and no one hears my voice. The cloud then showed his golden head, and his bright form emerged. And fearest thou because I vanish And am seen no more It is to tenfold life To love, to peace And raptures wholly Unseen descending Weigh my light wings Upon balmy flowers And court the fair I do To take me to her shining tent The weeping virgin Trembling kneels before the risen sun Till we arise Linked in a golden band and never part but walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers lives not alone nor of itself fear not and i will call the weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice come forth worm and the silent valley to thy pensive queen to find his partner in the veil. Image of weakness, art thou but a worm? I see they lay helpless and naked, weeping and none to answer, none to cherish thee with mother's smiles, and says, Thou mother of my children, I have loved thee, and I have given thee a crown that none can take away, and lay me down in thy cold bed, and leave my shining lot. Or an eye of gifts and graces, showering fruits in cointed gold? Why a tongue impressed with honey from every wind? Why an ear, a whirlpool, fierce to draw creations in?",6.610376834869385

The condition is that I will be permitted to make Luther talk American. Streamline him, so to speak, because you will never get people, whether in or outside the Lutheran church, actually to read Luther unless we make him talk as he would talk today to Americans. Let us begin with that, his commentary on Galatians. the undertaking which seemed so attractive when viewed as a literary task proved a most difficult one and at times became oppressive it was written in latin the work had to be condensed a word should now be said about the origin of luther's commentary on galatians much later when a friend of his was preparing an edition of all his latin works he remarked to his home circle if i had my way about it they would republish only those of my books which have doctrine My Galatians, for instance. In other words, these three men took down the lectures which Luther addressed to his students in the course of Galatians, and Rohrer prepared the manuscript for the printer. It presents, like no other of Luther's writings, the central thought of Christianity, the justification of the sinner for the sake of Christ's merits alone. But the essence of Luther's lectures is there. The Lord who has given us power to teach and to hear. Let him also give us the power to serve and to do. Luke 2. The word of our God shall stand forever.",2.0880377292633057

In five minutes I was in a new world, and my melancholy room was full of the liveliest French company. The sound of an imperative and uncompromising bell recalled me in due time to the regions of reality. Ambrose met me at the bottom of the stairs and showed me the way to the supper room. She signed to me with a ghostly solemnity to take the vacant place on the left of her father. The door opened again while I was still studying the two brothers, without, I honestly confess, being very favorably impressed by either of them. A new member of the family circle, who instantly attracted my attention, entered the room. A little cracked. That, in the popular phrase, was my impression of the stranger who now made his appearance in the supper room. Mr. Metacroft the Elder, having not spoken one word thus far, himself introduced the newcomer to me, with a side glance at his sons, which had something like defiance in it, a glance which, as I was sorry to notice, was returned with the defiance on their side by the two young men. Philip Lefrank, this is my overlooker, Mr. Iago, said the old man, formally presenting us. He is not well. He has come over the ocean for rest and change of scene. Mr. Iago is an American, Philip. Make acquaintance with Mr. Iago. Sit together. They pointedly drew back from John Iago as he approached the empty chair next to me and moved round to the opposite side of the table. A pretty girl, and so far as I could judge by appearances, a good girl, too. Describing her generally, I may say that she had a small head, well-carried, and well-set on her shoulders. Bright gray eyes that looked at you honestly and meant what they looked. A trim, slight little figure. Too slight for our English notions of beauty. a strong american accent and a rare thing in america a pleasantly toned voice which made the accent agreeable to english ears our first impressions of people are in nine cases out of ten the right impressions for once in a way i proved a true prophet the only cheerful conversation was the conversation across the table between naomi and me he looked up at naomi doubtingly When I addressed him, he answered constrainedly. A more dreary and more disunited family party I never sat at the table with. Envy, hatred, malice, and uncharitableness are never so essentially detestable to my mind as when they are animated by the sense of propriety and work under the surface. But for my interest in Naomi and my other interest in the little love looks which I now and then surprised passing between her and Ambrose, I should never have sat through that supper. I wish you good night. She laid her bony hands on the back of Mr. Metacroft's invalid chair, cut him short in his farewell salutation to me, and wheeled him out to his bed as if she were wheeling him out to his grave. You were quite right to say no, Ambrose began. Never smoke with Johnny Iago. His cigars will poison you. Naomi shook her forefinger reproachfully at them, as if the two sturdy young farmers had been two children. Silas slunk away without a word of protest. Ambrose stood his ground, evidently bent on making his peace with Naomi before he left her. Seeing that I was in the way, I walked aside toward a glass door at the lower end of the room.",4.560586214065552

There was something in his air and manner that betrayed to the scout the utter confusion of the state of his mind. The ingenious Hawkeye, who recalled the hasty manner in which the other had abandoned his post at the bedside of the sick woman, was not without his suspicions concerning the subject of so much solemn deliberation. The bear shook his shaggy sides, and then a well-known voice replied, Can these things be? returned David, breathing more freely as the truth began to dawn upon him. come come returned hawkeye uncasing his honest countenance the better to assure the wavering confidence of his companion you may see a skin which if it be not as white as one of the gentle ones has no tinge of red to it that the winds of the heaven and the sun have not bestowed now let us to business The young man is in bondage, and much I fear his death is decreed. I greatly mourn that one so well disposed should die in his ignorance, and I have sought a goodly hymn. Can you lead me to him? The task will not be difficult, returned David, hesitating, though I greatly fear your presence would rather increase than mitigate his unhappy fortunes. The lodge in which Uncas was confined was in the very center of the village, and in a situation perhaps more difficult than any other to approach or leave without observation. Four or five of the latter only lingered about the door of the prison of Uncas, wary but close observers of the manner of their captive. Delivered in a strong tone of assent, announced the gratification the savage would receive in witnessing such an exhibition of weakness in an enemy so long hated and so much feared. They drew back a little from the entrance, and motioned to the supposed conjurer to enter, but the bear, instead of obeying, maintained the seat it had taken, and growled. The cunning man is afraid that his breath will blow upon his brothers and take away their courage too, continued David, improving the hint he received. They must stand further off. Then, as if satisfied of their safety, the scout left his position and slowly entered the place. It was silent and gloomy, being tenanted solely by the captive, and lighted by the dying embers of a fire which had been used for the purpose of cookery. Uncas occupied a distant corner in a reclining attitude, being rigidly bound both hands and feet by strong and painful widths. The scout, who had left David at the door to ascertain they were not observed, thought it prudent to preserve his disguise until assured of their privacy. What shall we do with the mingos at the door? They count six, and this singer is as good as nothing. The Delawares are children of the tortoise, and they outstrip the deer. Uncas, who had already approached the door in readiness to lead the way, now recoiled and placed himself once more in the bottom of the lodge. But Hawkeye, who was too much occupied with his own thoughts to note the movement, continued speaking more to himself than to his companion. so uncas you had better take the lead while i will put on the skin again and trust to cunning for want of speed well what can't be done by main courage in war must be done by circumvention as soon as these dispositions were made the scout turned to david and gave him his parting instructions my pursuits are peaceful and my temper i humbly trust is greatly given to mercy and love returned david a little nettled at so direct an attack on his manhood but there are none who can say that i have ever forgotten my faith in the lord even in the greatest straits if you are not then knocked on the head your being a non-composer will protect you and you'll then have a good reason to expect to die in your bed so choose for yourself to make a rush or tarry here bravely and generously has he battled in my behalf and this and more will i dare in his service keep silent as long as may be and it would be wise when you do speak to break out suddenly in one of your shoutings which will serve to remind the indians that you are not altogether as responsible as men should be if however they take your scalp as i trust and believe they will not depend on it uncas and i will not forget the deed but revenge it as becomes true warriors and trusty friends Hold, said David, perceiving that with this assurance they were about to leave him. I am an unworthy and humble follower of one who taught not the damnable principle of revenge. Then, heaving a heavy sigh, probably among the last he ever drew in pining for a condition he had so long abandoned, he added, It is what I would wish to practice myself, as one without a cross of blood, though it is not always easy to deal with an Indian as you would with a fellow Christian. God bless you, friend. I do believe your scent is not greatly wrong, when the matter is duly considered, and keeping eternity before the eyes, though much depends on the natural gifts and the force of temptation. The Delaware dog, he said, leaning forward and peering through the dim light to catch the expression of the other's features, is he afraid? Will the Hurons hear his groans? The Mohican started on his feet and shook his shaggy covering as though the animal he counterfeited was about to make some desperate effort.

In the meantime, I had formed a new idea of her. By this time, Lord Chalford and Wilder returned, and, disgusted, rather, with myself, I ruminated on my want of generalship. And he made a little dip of his cane towards Brandon Hall, over his shoulder. Yes, so they said, but that would, I think, have been worse. If a fellow's been a little bit wild, he's Beelzebub at once. Bracton's a very good fellow, I can assure you. I don't know and can't say how you fine gentlemen define wickedness. Only, as an obscure female, I speak according to my lights, and he is generally thought the wickedest man in this county. Well, you know, Rady, women like wicked fellows. It is contrast, I suppose, but they do, and I'm sure, from what Bracton has said to me, I know him intimately, that Dorcas likes him, and I can't conceive why they are not married. Their walk continued silent for the greater part. Neither was quite satisfied with the other, but Rachel at last said, Now that's impossible, Rady, for I really don't think I once thought of him all this evening, except just while we were talking. There was a bright moonlight, broken by the shadows of overhanging boughs and withered leaves, and the mottled lights and shadows glided oddly across his pale features. Don't insult me, Stanley, by talking again as you did this morning. What I say is altogether on your own account. Mark my words, you'll find him too strong for you, aye, and too deep. I am very uneasy about it, whatever it is. I can't help it. To my mind, there has always been something inexpressibly awful in family feuds. The mystery of their origin, their capacity for evolving latent faculties of crime, and the steady vitality with which they survive the hearse and speak their deep-mouthed malignities in every newborn generation have associated them somehow in my mind with a spell of life exceeding and distinct from human and the special satanic action. the floor more than anything else showed the great age of the room my bed was unexceptionably comfortable but in my then mood i could have wished it a great deal more modern its curtains were of thick and faded tapestry all the furniture belonged to other times i shan't trouble you about my train of thoughts or fancies but i began to feel very like a gentleman in a ghost story watching experimentally in a haunted chamber i did not even take the precaution of smoking up the chimney i boldly lighted my cheroot a cold bright moon was shining with clear sharp lights and shadows the somber old trees like gigantic hearse plumes black and awful somehow i had grown nervous a little bit of plaster tumbled down the chimney and startled me confoundedly",4.140191555023193
2300-131720-0000,0.07780507780507781," The Paris plant, like that at the Crystal Palace, was a temporary exhibit. The London plant was less temporary, but not permanent, supplying, before it was torn out, no fewer than 3,000 lamps in hotels, churches, stores, and dwellings in the vicinity of Holborn Viaduct. There, Messiers Johnson and Hammer put into practice many of the ideas now standard in the art. and secured much useful data for the work in New York, of which the story has just been told. The dynamo-electric machine, though small, was robust, for under all the varying speeds of water power and the vicissitudes of the plant to which it belonged, it continued in active use until 1899, 17 years. Owing to his insistence on low pressure, Direct current for use in densely populated districts as the only safe and truly universal, profitable way of delivering electrical energy to the consumers, Edison has been frequently spoken of as an opponent of the alternating current. Why, if we erect a station at the falls, it is a great economy to get it up to the city? There seems no good reason for believing that it Broad as the prairies and free in thought as the winds that swept them, he is idiosyncratically opposed to loose and wasteful methods, to plans of empire that neglect the poor at the gate. Everything he has done has been aimed at the conservation of energy, the contraction of space, the intensification of culture. For some years it was not found feasible to operate motors on alternating current circuits. and that reason was often urged against it seriously. It could not be used for electroplating or deposition, nor could it charge storage batteries, all of which are easily within the ability of the direct current. But when it came to be a question of lighting a scattered suburb, a group of dwellings on the outskirts, a remote country residence, or a farmhouse, The alternating current, in all elements, save its danger, was and is ideal. Edison was intolerant of sham and shoddy, and nothing would satisfy him that could not stand cross-examination by microscope, test tube, and galvanometer. Unless he could secure an engine of smoother running, and more exactly govern and regulated than those available for his dynamo and lamp, Edison realized that he would find it almost impossible to give a steady light. Mr. Edison was a leader far ahead of the time. He obtained the desired speed and load with a friction brake, also regulator of speed, but waited for an indicator to verify it. Then again, there was no known way to lubricate an engine for continuous running. And Mr. Edison informed me that as a marine engine started before the ship left New York and continued running until it reached its home port, so an engine for his purposes must produce light at all times. Edison had installed his historic first great central station system in New York on the multiple arc system covered by his feeder and main invention, which resulted in a notable saving in the cost of conductors as against a straight two-wire system throughout of the tree kind. He soon foresaw that still greater economy would be necessary for commercial success not alone for the larger territory opening, but for the compact district of large cities. The strong position held by the Edison system, under the strenuous competition it was already springing up, was enormously improved by the introduction of the three-wire system, and it gave an immediate impetus to incandescent lighting. It was specially suited for a trial plant also. In the early days, when a yield of six or eight lamps to the horsepower was considered subject for congratulation, the street conductors were of the overhead pole line construction, and were installed by the construction company that had been organized by Edison to build and equip central stations. Meanwhile, he had called upon me to make a report of the three-wire system, known in England as the Hopkinson. both Dr. John Hopkinson and Mr. Edison being independent inventors at practically the same time. I think he was perhaps more appreciative that I was of the discipline of the Edison Construction Department, and thought it would be well for us to wait until the morning of the 4th before we started up. But the plant ran, and it was the first three-wire station in this country. They were later used as reserve machines, and finally, with the engine, retired from service as part of the collection of Edisonia. But they remain in practically as good condition as when installed in 1883. The arc lamp, installed outside a customer's premises, or in a circuit for public street lighting, burned so many hours nightly, so many nights in the month, and was paid for at that rate. Subject to rebate for hours when the lamp might be out through accident. Edison held that the electricity sold must be measured just like gas or water, and he proceeded to develop a meter. There was infinite skepticism around him on the subject. and while other inventors were also giving the subject their thought, the public took it for granted that anything so utterly intangible as electricity that could not be seen or weighed, and only gave secondary evidence of itself at the exact point of use, could not be brought to accurate registration. Hence the Edison electrolytic meter is no longer used, despite its excellent qualities. The principle employed in the Edison electrolytic meter is that which exemplifies the power of electricity to decompose a chemical substance. Associated with this simple form of apparatus were various ingenious details and refinements to secure regularity of operation, freedom from inaccuracy, and immunity from such tampering as would permit theft of current or damage. The standard Edison meter practice was to remove the cells once a month to the meter room of the Central Station Company for examination, another set being substituted. In December 1888, Mr. W. J. Jenks read an interesting paper before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on the six years of practical experience had up to that time with the meter, then more generally in use than any other. The others, having been in operation too short a time to show definite results, although they also went quickly to a dividend basis. In this connection, it should be mentioned that the Association of Edison Illuminating Companies in the same year adopted resolutions unanimously to the effect that the Edison meter was accurate and that its use was not expensive for stations above 1,000 lights. and that the best financial results were invariably secured in a station selling current by meter. The meter continued in general service during 1899, and probably up to the close of the century. He weighed and re-weaved the meter plates, and pursued every line of investigation imaginable, but all in vain. He felt he was up against it, and that perhaps another kind of a job would suit him better. The problem was solved. We were more interested in the technical condition of the station than in the commercial part. We had meters in which there were two bottles of liquid.",12.966123342514038

He panted to know if she too knew, or knew and cared not, or cared and knew not. She was so strange and human a creature. The world was water veiled in mists. Then of a sudden, at midday, the sun shot out, hot and still. No breath of air stirred. The sky was like blue steel. The earth steamed. Where was the use of imagining? The lagoon had been level with the dykes a week ago, and now? Perhaps she too might be there, waiting, weeping. He started at the thought. He hurried forth sadly. He splashed and stamped along farther and farther onward until he neared the rampart of the clearing and put foot upon the tree bridge. Then he looked down. The lagoon was dry. He stood a moment bewildered, then turned and rushed upon the island. A great sheet of dazzling sunlight swept the place, and beneath lay a mighty mass of olive green, thick, tall, wet, and willowy. The squares of cotton, sharp-edged, heavy, were just about to burst to bowls. For one long moment he paused, stupid, agape, with utter amazement, then leaned dizzily against the tree. He gazed about, perplexed, astonished. Here lay the reading of the riddle. with infinite work and pain someone had dug a canal from the lagoon to the creek into which the former had drained by a long and crooked way thus allowing it to empty directly he sat down weak bewildered and one thought was uppermost zora the years of the days of her dying were ten the hope and dream of harvest was upon the land up in the sick room zora lay on the little white bed the net and web of endless things had been crawling and creeping around her she had struggled in dumb speechless terror against some mighty grasping that strove for her life with gnarled and creeping fingers but now at last weakly she opened her eyes and questioned for a while she lay in her chair in happy dreamy pleasure at sun and bird and tree she rose with a fleeting glance gathered the shawl around her then gliding forward wavering tremulous slipped across the road and into the swamp. She had been born within its borders, within its borders she had lived and grown, and within its borders she had met her love. On she hurried until sweeping down to the lagoon and the island, lo, the cotton lay before her. The chair was empty, but he knew. He darted through the trees and paused, a tall man, strongly but slimly made.",3.9132583141326904
